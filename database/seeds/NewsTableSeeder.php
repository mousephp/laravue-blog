<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The present paper focuses on perception of teachers on the use of technology in Mathematics teaching and learning. Mathematics education is one of the domains where one can see prominent and growing effect of technology. It is believed and studied widely that use of technology can have positive effect on Mathematics teaching and learning, yet there seem to be some apprehension on the part of the teachers in the use of technology. This paper has attempted to study perception of teachers in detail on the use of technology in their Mathematics teaching and learning. The perception is studied with respect to the factors &ndash; experience of teachers and level of education. The relation between the perception and each factor is studied statistically and inferences are drawn. The sample of given study consisted of the teachers teaching in schools with convenient access to technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine how collegiate music teacher education programs prepare preservice teachers to utilize digital technology with K-12 music students. Fifty percent of NASM schools with music education programs (n = 250) were randomly selected. The head of music education or another music education professor from each institution was invited to complete an online survey regarding the role, nature, and efficacy of technology instruction in their program. Thirty-six percent (n = 89) responded. Of the responding schools, 47% of the programs reported their students participated in a course in music technology designed for all music majors, 33% required a music technology course specifically oriented to music education majors, 13% had students enroll in a technology class for education majors (non-music specific), and 78% integrated information and experiences related to the pedagogical uses of technology into music education classes. Preservice music teacher preparation was also examined within the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. the TPACK domains that included technology were rated as being less developed than the non-technology domains. Respondents reported their preservice teachers were prepared at a proficient level to integrate current and future music technology, but indicated lower levels of readiness to teach music classes that were fully technology-based. Lack of instructional time and/or space in the curriculum, and limited funding and/or access to technology were reported as common obstacles for integrating technology into the music teacher education curriculum.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates 23 Taiwanese EFL digital natives&rsquo; technological paedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) in teaching English to 23 digital immigrants in a Multimedia in English Instruction class in a language teacher education program in a university in the northwest of Taiwan. The data analysis of interviews, final projects, and videos yielded the following major findings. First, the digital natives&rsquo; TPCK was developed through collections of multimedia tools, teaching the digital immigrants, and activity designs. Second, these digital natives lacked competence in designing appropriate follow-up activities and tasks for the digital immigrants. Next, they also failed to provide step-by-step modelling and demonstration on using technology and multimedia tools. A framework on developing digital natives&rsquo; TPCK includes introduction of multimedia tools, provision of step-by-step modelling, recognition of adult learners&rsquo; needs, and designing interactive follow-up tasks.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology at school can be either integrated as an everyday support to normal, curricular activities or as a trigger for special projects. Drawing on the distributed cognition theory, the distributed TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge) model (Di Blas et al., 2014) claims that, at least in the latter case, the knowledge required does not reside in just the teacher&rsquo;s head but is rather distributed within a complex system of resources that includes students, colleagues, relatives, experts, the internet, etc. After introducing the distributed interpretation of the TPACK model, this paper focuses on the profile of the teachers who &ldquo;enact&rdquo; it within their classroom, based on data from a large case-study with digital storytelling at school. Results are quite surprising: most of the teachers are quite aged, with more than 20 years of teaching experience, with a background in humanities rather than science; many admit a poor command of Technology Knowledge. Yet, they succeed: benefits for their students are substantial,over a wide spectrum. What lesson can be drawn? That contrary to what may be expected, PK and not TK is probably the issue when introducing technology at school, at least in the case of special projects.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of the present research is defining TPACK education competence and epistemological beliefs of pre-service teachers, and presenting the relationship between TPACK education competence and epistemological belief. In accordance with this purpose, TPACK education competence scale and Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire were conducted on 342 (222 female-65%, 120 male-35%) pre-service teachers studying senior year at Necmettin Erbakan University, Faculty of Education in 2012-2013 academic-year. According to the findings obtained from the present designed in quantitative method, pre-service teachers&rsquo; epistemological belief scores are ranked as learning process-casting doubt on authority/expert knowledge, learning effort, innate/fixed ability, and certainty of knowledge. As for TPACK education competencies, pre-service teachers perceive themselves as advanced level. Another finding is that, gender is not an effective variable in terms of epistemological beliefs and TPACK education competencies among pre-service teachers. For the correlations between TPACK education competencies and epistemological beliefs among pre-service teachers, only learning process and doubt on expert knowledge factors are positively correlated with TPACK competencies at medium level. From this perspective, it can be claimed that TPACK education competencies are higher among pre-service teachers who tend to believe that acquiring knowledge process is important in learning.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study is to investigate pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK competencies with respect to variables of ICT usage level, ICT usage phase and gender. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design with no control group has been implemented. The study has covered 61 pre-service teachers attending education faculty of a state university between 2011-2012 academic year. TPACK-deep Scale, ICT Usage Level and ICT Usage Phase surveys have been employed. TPACK competencies which were in medium level prior to taking TPACK-based activities increased to higher level at the end of the process. Furthermore, certain amount of progress was found in the TPACK-deep subdimensions namely design, exertion, ethics and proficiency. At the end of the intervention, it was also determined that ICT usage phase of pre-service teachers increased. Consequently the rise in ICT usage levels of pre-service teachers correspondingly elevated their TPACK competencies. However no significant difference was found between TPACK competencies and gender. Most of the correlations between ICT usage phases and TPACK competency subdimensions were at medium-level significance. Some suggestions were provided based on the results.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This article describes a course-integrated collaborative project between a subject librarian, a communication professor, and an instructional designer that illustrates how the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework, developed by Mishra and Koehler (Mishra, P., &amp; Koehler, M. J. (2006). Technological pedagogical content knowledge: A framework for teacher knowledge. Teachers College Record, 108(6),1017&ndash;1054.), and the new ACRL Framework for Information Literacy (Framework) converge to support student learning in an online course in public speaking. Aligning TPACK with the Framework hones the behavioral, affective, cognitive, and metacognitive skills in the metaliterate learner. The authors illustrate how TPACK and the Framework can support the subject-specific content areas of public speaking by integrating information literacy learning objects throughout the entire online course.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates factors contributing to student engagement in an educational Facebook group. The study is based on survey results of 138 undergraduate mathematics students at a highly diverse urban public university. Survey measures included engagement in the Facebook group, access to Facebook, comfort using technology, and interest in the class. Quantitative analysis found that interest in the class and access to technology both positively correlate to engagement in a Facebook group. The results suggest that integrating a familiar technology in a novel way requires instructor effort, knowledge, and technique. Study findings are discussed in terms of the TPACK framework (technological pedagogical content knowledge), developed by Mishra &amp; Koehler (2006), emphasizing the importance of instructor preparation for effective instructional technology integration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper describes a professional development initiative of teacher educators, called the Digital Pedagogies Collaboration, in which the goal was to build faculty knowledge about technology enhanced teaching (TPACK knowledge), develop a collaborative learning and research community of faculty members around technology enhanced teaching, and provide opportunities for faculty to serve as future workshop facilitators and mentors for other faculty and students. Using a design-based research approach, data sources included workshop evaluation surveys, photographs of workshops in progress, researcher field notes, and narrative case reports constructed by faculty members actively involved in the collaborative re-search. Findings indicated that the Digital Pedagogies Collaboration was effective because it was: 1) based on faculty members&rsquo; expressed instructional needs, 2) used a TPACK-based professional learning workshop model that translated TPACK principles into practical classroom application, and 3) uniquely included a research collaboration that provided self-study reflection on participants&rsquo; changing teaching practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK has been a new issue of interest for the last decade. Koehler and Mishra (2005) suggested TPACK framework to address the knowledge needed for teachers to integrate technology in their classrooms. Self-reported scales are the most common measurement tools for TPACK. Surveys can inform about participants&rsquo; beliefs, views, attitudes, and dispositions that are the most effective on their decisions related to teach with or without technology. Most of the TPACK surveys have lack about reliability and validity. In this study, a valid and reliable survey called TPACK Self Assessment Scale (TPACK-SAS) was developed to identify pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-perceptions and self-assessments of their TPACK. The steps (item pool, expert review, item performance analyses, validity, reliability and factor analyses) suggested by DeVellis (2003) were followed in the scale development process. TPACK-SAS was administered to 754 preservice teachers. After the analyses process, it consisted of seven subdomains, similar with the original framework, and 67 items. Pre-service teachers were also asked whether they have their own computers or not, where they access internet, amount of time they spend using computers, proficiency of using computers and their intentions to use computers. The relationships between these variables and TPACK subdomain were investigated.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) encapsulates teachers&rsquo; pedagogical knowledge for the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT). It is created as teachers engage in collaborative talk during the design of ICT lessons. Design frames characterize teachers&rsquo; design reasoning and can substantially influence teachers&rsquo; TPACK considerations. Yet, this aspect of teachers&rsquo; TPACK is not well understood. This study examined the design talk conducted by 27 Singapore primary teachers as they worked in teams to integrate student-centered ICT lessons into their school curriculum. Through content analysis and chi-square analyses of about 35 h of coded design talk, it was found that teachers used seven design frames and predominantly considered pedagogical content knowledge, TPACK, and design knowledge when they engaged in ICT lesson design. Teachers consideration of pedagogical content knowledge was driven by design frames related to idea development, perception, enactment, institutional considerations, and interpersonal factors. On the other hand, teachers emphasized idea development and enactment when they considered TPACK. Teachers also had to consider the management of design processes during ICT lesson design. The implications for teacher ICT professional development are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

According to research findings, the most preferred teaching style group of teachers is facilitator/ personal model / expert, while the least preferred teaching style group is expert/ Formal Authority. While teachers&rsquo; TPACK levels did not change according to their gender, differentiation at technological knowledge (TK) levels were determined according to their seniority. In addition, differences were determined at technological knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK) and technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) levels in favour of the teachers who have computer. At the end of the study, a significant relationship between teaching styles and components of TPACK model has been identified. Furthermore, teaching styles that most predicted TPACK components were emerged as facilitator and formal authority.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study is to determine the technological pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers. The fundamental problem of the study consists of the investigation of teachers&rsquo; TPACK by their year of study and fields. This is a descriptive study. It was conducted using the survey model because it aimed to determine TPACK of the 995 pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers who participated in the study. They were in the departments of elementary school teaching and preschool teaching at three state universities in the spring term of the 2014-2015 academic year. The study found the means of junior (third year) and senior (fourth year) pre-service teachers in the departments of elementary school teaching and preschool teaching to be high. Their means were also high in the sub-dimensions of TPACK competence. The TPACK means of the pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers were found to be high. The TPACK means of senior pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers were determined to differ from those of junior pre-service preschool teachers. It can be stated that this difference resulted from technology and material development courses taken by the pre-service teachers in different semesters. Their pre-service education had positive effects on their TPACK. Providing pre-service technology education and practice as part of relevant courses will not be adequate. Along with the education, pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers should be provided with opportunities to use technology. These opportunities should go beyond the basis of courses that they take. It should be supplemented with practice in teaching practicum courses and should be included in practice evaluation forms as a criterion. The sub dimensions of TPACK can be examined, and TPACK competency can be assessed in specific teaching programs in further studies.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) has been well accepted as a framework to understand and describe types of knowledge required by teachers to teach specific content with technology effectively. However, limited studies have used the framework in analysing the complexity of technology integration in mathematics classrooms. This study investigates, through examining critical instructional events, the most influential TPACK constructs in understanding and shaping teachers&rsquo; pedagogical practices using digital technology. This case study was conducted in an early secondary mathematics classroom in Indonesia that used a web-based resource to support students&rsquo; understanding of fractions. The finding suggests that the qualitative examination of the four intersected TPACK constructs assists in understanding the challenges and the opportunities to teachers when utilising an exploratory-based technology. It demonstrates that the combination of pedagogical stances and choice of technology significantly influence the visibility of other TPACK constructs. Implications of this study include the need of thoughtful planning prior to using web-based resources and the importance to utilise critical events in developing and assessing teachers&rsquo; TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the Teacher Intentions to Integrate Technology in Education Scale using pre-service teacher samples from three countries on three continents &ndash; Turkey, Spain and the United States. Study participants were 550 pre-service teachers from three universities in Turkey, Spain and the USA (219, 209, and 122 respectively). The majority of the participants were female. All of the participants were junior and senior students enrolled in elementary teacher education programs. Specifically, this study compared pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy, outcome expectations, intentions (internal factors) and perceived school climate (external factor) for technology integration in education in these countries. The results of confirmatory factor analysis in this study supported the construct validity of the scale in all three samples. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative contribution of self-efficacy, outcome expectations and perceived school climate on pre-service teachers&rsquo; intentions to integrate technology into their future classroom activities. The external factor of school climate predicted pre-service teachers&rsquo; intention to integrate technology in education in all three samples. However, there were certain differences among the teachers from different countries in our sample in terms of technology integration. Unlike Turkey and the US, self-efficacy predicted technology integration intention to a smaller degree than school climate in the Spanish sample. Interestingly, outcome expectations scores did not make a statistically significant contribution to predicting pre-service teachers&rsquo; intention to use technology in the US sample. Given this study&rsquo;s findings, it is important to consider differences in technology integration intentions that exist in different countries, when conducting empirical research on teacher perceptions of using technology for teaching and learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological, pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) has been used by hundreds of studies as a theoretical framework to explore teachers&rsquo; technology use in classroom settings. While these studies have contributed to understandings of the interplay between these different knowledge domains and the differences between pre- and in-service teachers&rsquo; knowledge, little work has been done to examine the influence of teachers&rsquo; socially mediated workplace settings on TPACK enactment. This paper examines the impact of situated, social contextual factors on teachers&rsquo; knowledge development and enactment by reporting findings from an eight month case study involving ten teachers in an Australian secondary school. Results reported in this paper indicate that TPACK enactment is influenced by processes of identity development and practice. These findings challenge the established position of knowledge as an epistemological possession inherent in the TPACK framework rather than also considering knowing as an epistemology of practice. Implications for in-service teachers and school authorities are discussed and three conclusions are presented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examined how preservice English Language Arts teachers learn to teach and use their knowledge of content, pedagogy, and technology during an English education course focused on technology. Seeking to address a gap in the research, this study utilized a case study methodology to look at preservice teachers&rsquo; learning about the flipped classroom and designing lessons integrating technology as a way for a teacher education course to facilitate preservice teachers&rsquo; construction of their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. The participants were preservice English teachers taking an online English education course during Summer 2015. The researcher used a survey to purposefully select nine individuals with a range of self-reported knowledge. Participants were then interviewed twice, had their course assignments collected and analyzed, and submitted three written reflections. The course that the participants took challenged preservice teachers to bring together their content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge to create flipped lessons videos and a series of lesson plans. The data showed that there was no pattern or stages of TPACK development. Participants saw potential for flipped learning to be useful in secondary English classes and thought about when and what content they could flip.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;A theoretical framework has emerged recently to guide research in the teachers&rsquo; use of ICT and it is the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). Early research indicates that Blended learning is increasingly being adopted at all levels of educational system. It is considered as a way to foster engaging in interactive learning experiences. The purpose of this article was to determine the levels of ICT knowledge on e-course design through blended learning approach among science teachers of secondary schools in Yemen. The study was conducted on the sample of 60 science teacher trainees in Ibb city. The ICT knowledge scale was used based on TPACK. To analyze the data t-test was used. The findings in this study indicated that TPACK has provided a valuable tool for assessing teacher knowledge in the area of technology integration, the teachers&rsquo; ICT knowledge was above average in two groups, and there is significant difference between experimental and control groups on ICT knowledge scale. Recommendations are made for future research on online collaboration activities to raise awareness of factors related to online group work and to determine the in-service training needs of teachers on ICT use to follow-up support and to ensure successful utilization of new technologies.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this phenomenological case study was to investigate the lived experiences of preservice music teachers using iPads to engage secondary general music students in creating and performing music during field teaching experiences. Two questions guided this research study: (a) What are these preservice teachers&rsquo; perceptions of their experiences using iPads to create music and to teach? (b) How do these experiences influence their perceptions of the technology&rsquo;s effectiveness as a teaching tool? Data were reflections of nine preservice teachers collected over 5 weeks. The essence of the experience was the preservice teachers&rsquo; struggle to resolve tensions that emerged while using technology to create and teach music. Tensions caused some to examine cherished beliefs and practices and influenced their development of TPACK (technological pedagogical and content knowledge). Three themes support the essence: (a) tensions, (b) innovation and adaptation, and (c) influence of experiences on perceptions of technology.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Four distinct constructs were identified from a survey of a sample of pre-service science teachers at a regional Australian University. The constructs emerged after employing Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on respondents&rsquo; perceptions of pedagogical practices incorporating the use of Information Communication and Technology (ICT). The key components of the survey were derived from a Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) survey developed for a national project. For future investigations of TPACK application in university contexts, a four-construct configuration of pre-service teacher TPACK perceptions is proposed requiring empirical confirmation. This inquiry depicts a portrait of emerging domains of TPACK. The relevance of the findings and their implications for universities that rely heavily on ICT in the delivery of are discussed, especially in relation to improving teaching practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Over the last few decades, the incorporation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) into daily pedagogical practices has been viewed as a viable solution for the innovation of educational systems. Teachers have been seen as crucial actors in this process, and therefore much emphasis has been put on the necessity to provide them with adequate technological and pedagogical competences through training and lifelong learning. However, while a greater knowledge of teachers&rsquo; level of skills in technology-enhanced learning would be extremely helpful to deliver effective training courses, up to now, empirical studies on teachers&rsquo; digital and pedagogical skills have been poor and fragmented, especially in developing and populous countries such as China.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Research evidence exists to support the implementation of learner-centered approaches in technological usage and in teaching methodologies. This chapter uses qualitative observation data on implementation of learner-centered approaches in technology integrated classrooms collected by two participant observers. Findings indicate that the problems that some instructional technology researchers in the past decade have found still persist despite the extensive technology professional development designed to enhance the use of technology in a learner-centered approach. The TPACK framework which is used as a guide to effective technology integration has not been fully utilized by many who offer professional development or those who design technology courses at teacher preparation programs. Two major problems noted in observation notes are: 1) those who provide professional development do not begin with the background of the TPACK framework; 2) the TPACK framework is usually discussed in isolation of other frameworks such as the UDL framework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Self-Efficacy (SE) and technology acceptance are two contributors related to Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Many studies have indicated that TPACK is correlated with SE and the level of technology acceptance in both traditional and online learning environments. Studies using mobile learning devices in the classroom, however, are yet to be established. The authors conducted an empirical study by investigating mobile-based TPACK, SE, and technology acceptance of more than 500 English teachers from about 220 elementary schools in China, who used Android system-based pad in classrooms for one year. As a result, SE and technology acceptance had indirect positive effects on mobile-based TPACK, while no significant difference was observed in gender for TPACK. However, younger teachers and teachers with higher levels of education showed superior TPACK levels than other participants in the study. Finally, several implications for teacher professional development, limitations, and future research plans are presented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Guided by the TPACK theory (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), this chapter reviews and compares the technology standards related to and designed for teachers of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) from the entry level to the accomplished level in the United States and China. It has found that the technology standards are often included in the comprehensive standards for teachers and parallel the standards about other aspects of teaching. The technology standards related to CFL in the two countries share some similarities but also differ in important ways. Several important and critical understandings are identified, including the needs for CFL technology standards, the theoretical foundations for CFL technology standards, and a more solid and comprehensive infrastructure for CFL education. Recommendations are made to address the needs, and research is called for to study the development and implementation of CFL technology standards.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has become an emphasized component of PreK-12 education in the United States. The US is struggling to produce enough science, mathematics, and technology experts to meet its national and global needs, and the mean scores of science and mathematics students are not meeting the expected levels desired by our leaders (Hossain &amp; Robinson, 2011). In an effort to improve achievement scores in mathematics and science, school districts must consider many components that can contribute to the development of a classroom where students are engaged and growing academically. Computer technology (CT) for student use is a popular avenue for school districts to pursue in their goal to attain higher achievement. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of iPads in a one-to-one setting, where every student has his own device 24/7, to determine the effects, if any, on academic achievement in the areas of mathematics and science. This comparison study used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine three middle schools in a private school district. Two of the schools have implemented a one-to-one iPad program with their sixth through eighth grades and the third school uses computers on limited occasions in the classroom and in a computer lab setting. The questions addressed were what effect, if any, do the implementation of a one-to-one iPad program and a teacher&rsquo;s perception of his use of constructivist teaching strategies have on student academic achievement in the mathematics and science middle school classrooms. The research showed that although the program helped promote the use of constructivist activities through the use of technology, the one-to-one iPad initiative had no effect on academic achievement in the middle school mathematics and science classrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this dissertation is to describe and understand how teachers describe the changes in their practices as a result of ten years [of] participation in a one-to-one environment. This research study focuses on one successful middle school&rsquo;s adoption of laptops to support teaching and learning. A qualitative study using interviews of key participants was undertaken with teachers and administrators. The Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework was used in conjunction with Rogers&rsquo; Diffusion of Innovation framework to understand from the participants&rsquo; perspective changes to their practice. The results indicate teachers underwent changes in their use of technology to support teaching and learning, showing increasing overlap between the domains of technological and pedagogical knowledge. The changes resulted in an increase in the transparency of the teaching and learning process for other teachers, students, administrators, and parent. These changes were supported by four school-wide factors; the adoption of a common software suite, robust social networks, modeling by leadership and the professional development model used. The findings were discussed in relation to participants&rsquo; position on the adoption spectrum of Rogers&rsquo; Diffusion of Innovation theory.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine what effective teaching with technology looked like in practice within middle grade Social Studies&rsquo; classrooms. An additional purpose was to understand how teachers&rsquo; combine content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge when making decisions about their curriculum. Guiding this study was a conceptual framework that suggests effective teaching with technology comes from technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), a knowledge that is created by combining content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Lakeside Middle School was selected for this study due to both its commitment to technology integration and its implementation of a school wide 1:1 laptop initiative. Three middle grade Social Studies&rsquo; teachers at Lakeside were selected, one each from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms. A multiple case study methodology was used in this study. An observation protocol, designed specifically to capture TPACK moments during observations, was developed. Multiple data sources (interviews, observations, focus group, and artifacts) were collected and analyzed for emerging themes about the TPACK practices of each teacher. Using the data collected, a descriptive case study was written for each teacher. These descriptive case studies identified examples, grouped thematically, of TPACK in practice. These descriptive case studies also recorded each teacher&rsquo;s beliefs about teaching, technology in education, and their own placement within the TPACK framework. Data analysis suggested that that TPACK is developed uniquely in each teacher, shaped by their beliefs and strengths in teaching. Analysis of the data also suggested that the TPACK framework may need to be rethought, in order to fully capture TPACK in practice. Included in this are discussions about how the TPACK framework model fails to account for any of the three teachers&rsquo; TPACK practices, discussions about the model&rsquo;s failure to differentiate between depth and breadth of TPACK knowledge, and discussions about other factors that influence TPACK in practice, including students and teaching environment. The study findings have implications for teacher educators, teachers, and policy makers. Specifically, teacher education courses need to be developed to address the lack of TPACK knowledge that preservice teachers have. Additionally, new professional development sessions are needed for practicing teachers that focus on developing both the depth and breadth of their TPACK practices.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Current research from 2010&ndash;2016 indicates online learner grades have dropped at for- profit virtual institutions. During this same period, part-time online faculty made up for 80&ndash;90% of online faculty at for-profit virtual institutions. There is evidence of low online learner grades in an era of increased use of part-time online faculty. The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental study was to examine the relationship between seven self-reported predictor variables of part-time online faculty working at a private for-profit virtual institution and the criterion variable, online learners&rsquo; grades. A total of 81 out of 148 faculty members participated in the TPACK Survey. Multiple linear regressions and a Pearson r correlation coefficient were used to analyze data. Results of the analyses indicated the seven self-reported predictor variables of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of part-time online instructors did not predict online learners&rsquo; grades. Study findings imply that the domains of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of part-time online instructors do not account for low online learners&rsquo; grades. Close analysis of other predictor variables that may account for low online learner grades is recommended.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;To advance both transformative school leadership skills and the use of ICT integration in this school, while aiming to enhance positive school change, this study used the iTEaCH (ICTTechnogogy-and-Collegiality) Implementation Model proposed by Choy (2013) to investigate, quantitatively, teacher perceptions of ICT use in a case study school in Tanzania. The iTEaCH Implementation Model provides focus on teachers&rsquo; choice of technology use, desire for technology use, pedagogy perceptions, and collegiality to identify gaps that might be used to inform teachers and school leaders of technology provision, professional development, and collegial support needs in the school. Using a slightly modified version of the Choy and Ng (2015) data gathering tool (Appendix A) data were collected to investigate the teachers&rsquo; use of technology across three dimensions, namely; types of technology available in the school, teachers&rsquo; pedagogical preferences, and the level of teacher support or collegiality experienced by teachers in the school.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study intended to investigate the research questions:</p>
<p>1. How do teachers respond to the iTEaCH technology implementation model survey?</p>
<p>2. How can the teachers&rsquo; attitudes about a change in practice be used by school</p>
<p>leadership to design a working model for ICT integration in the school?</p>
<p>The results showed that teacher use of technology in the classroom was positively correlated with three research variables namely; with a teacher&rsquo;s desire to use technology; teachers feeling that they have the pedagogic skills to use technology in the classroom, and teachers having colleague/school support to use technology in the classroom. Also, teacher use of technology in the classroom was significantly different between types of interactive learning. The results from the the iTEaCH Implementation Model survey provided data that could be used to assist the school leadership plan budgets for technology provision and for the concomitant professional development of staff. Additionally, the selective focus of this model allowed for the empowerment of both teacher and school leadership to focus on and possibly identify technological, pedagogical and collegial interventions that are needed in the school better meet the need of 21st -century teaching and learning.&rdquo;</p>

Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10109526)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Changes in the field of education require teachers&rsquo; acquisition of specific knowledge of technology and the skills of its effective use in the classroom. With the expansion of the traditional classroom to include virtual learning environments, concern still exists regarding characteristics necessary for quality teaching and learning.</p>
<p>This research is an examination of pre-service teachers&rsquo; needs relevant to integrating technology in an online learning environment. It is a first step toward acknowledging the responsibility teacher preparation programs have in the formation of educators equipped to instruct in dual learning environments, thus providing pre-service teachers with opportunities and experiences to become fluent in the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) required for online learning environments as well as the traditional face-to-face instruction.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if active engagement with content of an online instruction module would affect the attitudes, knowledge and skills, and instructional centeredness of pre-service teachers&rsquo; towards technology integration in an online learning environment. A mixed-methods concurrent triangulation design procedure was utilized to measure characteristics of pre-service teachers in a teacher preparation program. A two-way within-subjects analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effect of engagement with the content of the online instruction module for all three domains. Participants began the intervention with limited knowledge and skills of technology integration and online learning environments; however, they made statistically significant gains upon completion of the intervention. The implementation of an intervention such as this online instruction module may support other teacher preparation programs in identifying strengths and weaknesses of their pre-service teachers and provide valuable information necessary to guide program goals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study sought to identify key experiences that impact the development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of preservice secondary sciences teachers at a medium-sized university in Queensland, Australia. TPACK is a conceptual framework of a body of knowledge that teachers draw upon to influence practice; it is a dynamic and emergent form of knowledge that informs the employment of technology for teaching specific subject matter.</p>
<p>This study employed an embedded case study approach, including delivery of a TPACK survey instrument and analysis of participant interviews, to identify the context-specific experiences that promote the development of TPACK among twelve preservice secondary science teachers. The research addresses a specific need cited in the literature, identifying TPACK impact factors, and provides a novel way to visualize TPACK development through contextual experiences.</p>
<p>A novel approach to visually representing context-specific experiences and their influence on teacher knowledge, self-efficacy, values and beliefs was employed. Three major findings are presented below: 1) the majority of preservice secondary science teachers were unable to define the constructs of learning and science; 2) a focus on motivation and interest paired with a disconnect between expressed and enacted pedagogical orientation lead to teacher-centered instruction augmented with superficial tactics aimed at generating interest; and 3) difficulty in integrating knowledge bases yielded lower TPACK self-efficacy, which has detrimental impacts on the instruction planned by pre-service teachers for their students. Findings are directly aligned with participants&rsquo; prior experience, compared to the relevant literature, and utilized to identify implications for teacher preparation as well as recommendations for future research.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The use of educational technologies is a key component of education reform. In its</p>
<p>current national technology plan, Future Ready Learning: Reimagining the Role of Technology in Education, the U.S. Department of Education asserts that educational technologies can transform student learning. Successful integration of educational technology could increase student achievement and transform the setting to bring about positive social change. The purpose of this study was to provide a group of expert panelists an opportunity to identify strategies and guidelines to create an effective educational technology plan. Data were gathered using a modified Delphi technique from 7 teachers, 8 administrators, and 7 policymakers. All had expertise in educational technologies and experience with past state technology implementations, and all used a Delphi instrument to rate statements from current research. Their recommendations confirmed the importance of each stage of Rogers&rsquo; 5 stages of the innovation-decision process; the panelists also reached consensus about the role of the state and its responsibility to provide support and guidance to districts and schools when implementing educational technology plans. The results showed that an individualized approach to implementation of an educational technology innovation, rather than an organizational approach, may improve the rate of diffusion and adoption of educational technology innovations in this state&rsquo;s K-12 public schools.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In the United States, both Common Core standards and 21st century learning skills are dictating educational policy, while teachers are expected to teach to standardized tests while also providing students authentic learning experiences. Creating these authentic learning experiences involves not only ensuring learning will occur, but also connecting the lesson to real world examples. These connections are increasingly made possible in classrooms through the use of mobile technology. Art museums are also taking advantage of digital tools to develop mobile applications that extend interactions with artworks beyond the museum&rsquo;s walls. It is at this intersection of classrooms, mobile technology, and art museums that this study originated. The study focuses on how two elementary educators integrated online art museum resources into their curriculum using mobile technology, and what pertinent implications arise from these experiences that can be applied to developing substantive art museum resources. I prepared myself for the study by reviewing literature concerning constructivism (Hein, 1990), andragogy (Knowles, 1990), mobile technology, technology integration into classrooms, and art museum resources. Working alongside one art specialist and one vii math teacher, I sought to understand each teacher&rsquo;s experience with bringing art museum mobile applications and iPads into their curriculum. It was important to include in the study my voice as a researcher, as well as the voices of the teachers. I, therefore, adopted a narrative approach to reporting the data that enabled our three stories to intersect. The trio of narratives reflect our experiences as I interacted with the teachers as they designed and conducted lessons that utilized museum developed mobile applications of their choice and hosted on iPads. I used the Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Koehler, Mishra, &amp; Cain, 2013) to identify how each teacher&rsquo;s technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge areas interacted during their teaching. Both educators&rsquo; familiarity with, and evolution of, their technological pedagogical knowledge correlated with their perceived success of the lesson. From the teachers&rsquo; experiences, I was better able to identify and understand the importance of collaborating with teachers in research, the unique opportunities for increasing interaction with art museum objects by embracing mobile technology, and the potential for collaborating between universities and art museums in digital projects.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study was aimed to explore the special education teachers&rsquo; perceptions of technology and Internet for teaching. The interview data were analyzed by using phenomenographic method, and seven categories of special education teachers&rsquo; perceptions for technology and Internet of teaching were found: Tool, Toy, Telecommunication, Treasure of information, Territory, Tour and Trend. The specific &lsquo;Tree of special education teachers&rsquo; perceptions of technology for teaching&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tree of special education teachers&rsquo; perceptions of Internet for teaching&rsquo; were proposed to represent special education teachers&rsquo; multiple perceptions. This study also found that special education teachers with more agreements for the perceptions of &lsquo;Toy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Trend&rsquo; in technology tended to display higher technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK), and with more agreements for the perceptions of &lsquo;Tour&rsquo; in Internet tended to display higher Web-based Pedagogical Content Knowledge (WPCK).&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceived TPACK (technological pedagogical content knowledge) level of in-service English language teachers, to examine the correlation among the TPACK components, and to explore the extent in which TPACK components correlate with demographic characteristics (age, years of experience, level of education). Findings revealed that teachers&rsquo; knowledge in technology was not as strong as their knowledge in pedagogy and content. Correlations between the subscale variables in the TPACK were significant except for the relationship between content and technology. A significant and positive correlation found between Teachers&rsquo; age and pedagogy, content, and pedagogical content knowledge, between experience and pedagogy and pedagogical content knowledge, and between education level and pedagogy, pedagogical content knowledge and technological content knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teacher acceptance is the key for the successful implementation of a new technology in education settings. While the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) offers a well-validated solution in explaining the behavioral intention of adopting an emerging technology, there are research gaps in understanding the determinants of the components in the model. Extending the previous model and applying it in the context of adoption of student response system (a.k.a. clickers), the current study explored the underlying factors that influence the core components of UTAUT&mdash; effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. In particular, the study examined the impact of teachers&rsquo; knowledge on the evaluation of those components. Incorporating the concepts of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), the study attempted to investigate the association of teachers&rsquo; knowledge and the major components in UTAUT. Fifty- two teachers from 7 faculties at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University participated in our teacher survey between May and July 2015. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation analysis reveals that technological knowledge was positively correlated with effort expectancy (p&lt;.01), and behavioral intention (p&gt;.01). Further, there were positive associations between TPACK and performance expectancy (p&gt;.01), as well as behavioral intention (p&gt;.01). Findings supported the hypothesis that teachers&rsquo; knowledge is relevant to the perception on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions. In terms of theoretical implication, the current study extends the UTAUT by integrating the key concepts of TPACK in explaining the adoption of an emerging technology. As for practical implication, the study sheds light on strategies for successful implementation of clickers in university settings.&rdquo;</p>

Developing teacher students&rsquo; TPACK-in-action: Google Maps as a thinking tool in geography instruction. Paper presented at the European Conference on Educational Research 2012, Cadiz, Spain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The aim of this study is to develop ways to support teacher students&acute; skills and knowledge for the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in the teaching of geography. Nowadays, teachers need diverse knowledge and skills for teaching with ICT and these have been described by Koehler and Mishra (2005) in the TPACK model. According to Koehler and Mishra (2005, 2009) the main components in the TPACK model are content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK) and technological knowledge (TK). TPACK can be seen as a mixture of these components, offering the knowledge needed for supporting students&rsquo; learning of specific content and using ICT in a pedagogically meaningful way (Koehler &amp; Mishra 2005). It is also important to notice that the teachers&acute; TPACK is influenced by contextual factors, such culture, socioeconomic status and the school organization. (Harris, Mishra, &amp; Koehler, 2009). &ldquo;</p>

Paper presented at Thomas Jefferson University Faculty Days, Philadelphia, PA. Retrieved from http://jdc.jefferson.edu/tjufacultydays/42</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Instructors at all levels indicate a growing awareness of educational technology and an intention to use technology for teaching. However, a divide exists between adoption and effective integration. The presentation outlines the difference between adopting a technology and integrating a technology. The Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) offers a framework that describes the stages of integration. However, CBAM fails to address the pedagogy plays in integration of technology. The TPACK (Technology, Pedagagy, and Content Knowledge) framework addresses the important overlap between pedagogy, teaching and subject matter expertise in integration. TPACK; however, does not address the stages of implementation or suggest the key environment conditions that support adoption. The presentation provides an alternative model that draws upon CBAM and TPACK to describe an adoption timeline and key characteristics of integration. The presentation will address factors influencing successful integration at the individual and institutional levels.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The importance of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) in preparing effective teachers in this technological age has been recognized. Many quantitative TPACK assessments have been developed, but they did not seem to be able to help teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to diagnose the needs for professional development. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present the development of a TPACK assessment in English language arts that better address the needs of EFL teachers in developing their TPACK. In total, 180 teachers participated in the study. Data collected included results of a TPACK survey, interview notes, and observation notes. In this study, the analytical frameworks include the TPACK framework and the Revised Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy. A preliminary TPACK assessment in English language arts was suggested for the EFL teachers to self-evaluate their TPACK needs. The paper concludes with suggestion for future research and practices.&rdquo;</p>

Paper presented at the 11th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Canary Islands, Spain. doi:10.1109/CISTI.2016.7521433</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The ongoing communicational transformation brought on by digital technology and the increasing imbrication of reticular ecosystems amplify their effects and changes in social life, defining new relationship configurations. The practices and trends of incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into education, published in the past five years, points to a trend of simply transposing everyday ICT into school processes, without taking into account the necessary pedagogical, technical and conceptual adjustments, nor other factors of the educational complexity. This paper presents an alternative application of an extension to TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge) framework model with CCI (integrated cognitive skills) application for incorporation of technology in the educational process as a way of overcoming these difficulties. The combined application of technological and pedagogical skills in this hybridized model allows the enhancement of learning processes by thinking of education and technology as integrated tools, becoming absolutely vital for better understanding, rethinking and reformulating syllabi, educational policies and practices so as to improve teaching processes.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teaching with technology still remains as a challenge. Making judicious choices of when, what and how specific tools and pedagogies to use in the teaching of a topic can be improved with the help of curriculum inventories, training, and practices but as new and more capable technologies arrive, such resources and experience do not often transfer to new circumstances. This article presents a case study in which computational modeling and simulation technology (CMST) is used to improve technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of teachers. We report findings of a summer training program for both pre-service and in-service teachers in the Northeastern United States. CMST has shown to be effective on both teaching and learning. Results show that it helps teachers to integrate technology into their teaching in a more permanent, constructive, and tool-independent way. It has also shown to improve student learning in a constructive fashion by first enabling deductive introduction of a topic from a general simplistic framework and then guiding the learner to inductively discover underlying STEM principles through experimentation.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This design-based research explores professional growth of in-service English teachers in Israel. Participating teachers took part in one of two iterations of a professional development course focusing on the integration of technology in English teaching. Both iterations were designed based on a cognitive apprenticeship approach and the use of the model of Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as a lens for teachers to implement and evaluate the integration of technology in their own classrooms. The mediating process of reflection has been added to the second iteration in the form of reflective writing. Quantitative analysis of pre-post TPACK questionnaires shows significant improvement of teachers&rsquo; perceptions in the first iteration. Results of the second iteration confirm and extend the findings of the first one. The course is a promising model for supporting teachers in developing the capacity for integrating technology into their everyday teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2017 SPECIAL ISSUE of the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET):<br />Future Directions in TPCK/TPACK Research and Development</p>
<p>Guest Editors<br />Judith B. Harris, College of William &amp; Mary<br />Michael Phillips, Monash University<br />Matthew J. Koehler, Michigan State University<br />Joshua M. Rosenberg, Michigan State University</p>
<p>Focus of the Special Issue<br />Building upon Shulman&rsquo;s (1986; 1987) influential notions of pedagogical content knowledge, or the knowledge needed to teach effectively (and differently) within different curriculum areas, educational technology researchers have embraced technological pedagogical content knowledge, or TPCK/TPACK (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2005; Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; Niess, 2005).<br />TPACK scholarship examines how to develop, apply, and assess this knowledge in diverse education settings and content areas. During the last decade, multiple ways to understand and support its development have emerged, generating approximately 1,000 publications that utilize the construct, impacting the practice of postsecondary faculty, administrators, and others invested in meaningful educational uses of technology.</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, TPACK&rsquo;s enthusiastic reception and rapid dissemination have generated multiple points of divergence which need further study, such as:<br />The specific nature of the knowledge that TPACK describes;<br />How to understand and describe contextual influences upon instructors&rsquo; TPACK;<br />How to measure this knowledge appropriately;<br />How to structure TPACK development in accordance with different adult learners&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>Given the widespread diffusion of TPACK, research focusing upon these and related issues will help to determine the direction of future postsecondary learning and teaching with technologies. Therefore, this special issue of AJET will address future directions in TPCK/TPACK research and development. Please note that since AJET&rsquo;s focus and scope address post-secondary education, submitted manuscripts should speak to TPCK/TPACK in higher education, professional learning/development for teachers and university faculty, and/or educators&rsquo; workplace learning.</p>

Advance online publication. doi:10.1111/bjet.12514</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) involves an awareness of instructional approaches, methods, and knowledge of building on technology to enhance students&rsquo; learning. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the TPACK of teachers in Saudi Arabia and USA, and then describe the factors affecting teachers&rsquo; TPACK through an analysis of covariance that incorporates age, teaching experience, and education level as covariates, and the seven levels of TPACK as dependent variables. Differences found between teachers in the US and Saudi Arabia in terms of TPK, and TPCK. The analysis of variance indicated that teachers&rsquo; from the US and Saudi Arabia differ in their perceived TPACK when controlled by years of teaching experience, and educational levels. Teachers in both the US and Saudi Arabia had higher rating of their knowledge in content and pedagogy than technology knowledge. Teachers in Saudi Arabia, however, had higher TK, TCK, TPK and TPCK than teachers in the US.&rdquo;</p>

The instruments to collect the data were a questionnaire, chat transcripts and a voice re-cording. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed to explore type of TPACK episodes taking place, type of telecollaboration, changes or suggestions for improvement of CLIL units, and perceived advantages and constraints of the telecollaboration. Results suggest students&rsquo; attention focused on technology while talking about the telecollaboration, but on pedagogy and content when talking about the unit.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK is a framework for the learning process in which educators combine Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge to deliver the learning experience. Therefore, TPACK can be defined as a complex interaction between the technology, pedagogy and content. TPACK expresses the overlap between these factors in a two-dimensional space, placing TPACK at the centre. Educators can place their teaching episode within this space and ask, if I place my delivery at this point is it the best point in the TPACK space? Secondly educators may ask how can the best point within the space be determined? The CPT model proposes an attempt to address these questions by recasting TPACK as a three-dimensional pseudo-vector space allowing expected outcomes and observed outcomes to be analysed. For the study presented here our null hypothesis is: H0 = there is no significant difference between the observed and expected outcomes.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper analyses the theoretical construct of professional practice knowledge; the &lsquo;tacit knowledge&rsquo; that all teachers use when engaging with digital technologies. To reach this end and to gather the views of tutors, a framework developed by Mishra and Koehler &ndash;Technological Pedagogical and Content Framework (TPACK) &ndash; was employed. This was used in parallel with the Flanders Interaction Analysis Category (FIAC) Framework to collect semi-structured interview and interaction analysis data. This paper will present a selection of the data gathered and analysed using the TPACK framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The research found that faculty need ongoing training opportunities where they can develop their professional practice in order to use Synchronous Computer Mediated Conferencing (SCMC) tools to design interactive sessions that are not teacher dominated. The paper recommends that HE institutions design a signature pedagogy for academic staff and students on how SCMC technology can be used within specific online interactive programmes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It also found that there is a need for academic staff to capture their own professional practice; to sit back and ask, what is going on here? Having reflected on their practice, tutors should then be encouraged to share their own experiences, or their tacit knowledge, with their peers. Institutions can then begin to capture and reflect on this &lsquo;hot action&rsquo; around the use of SCMC technologies.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The authors of this study utilized the TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge) framework in developing and assessing these skills within an advanced technology integration course for preservice teachers. The research contributes to the use of TPACK as a metric for measuring technology integration of pre-service teachers. Two groups of students enrolled in an undergraduate teaching certification program, at a medium size liberal arts university participated in this study. One group was explicitly taught the TPACK framework while the other group was not. Both groups then completed a pre/post TPACK assessment. Analysis of the pre/post TPACK assessment instrument and fieldwork reflections revealed positive results in explicitly using the TPACK framework in developing these skills in preservice teachers. However, the positive results were not as evident when analyzing the student lesson plans.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this article, we explore creativity alongside educational technology, as fundamental constructs of 21st century education. Creativity has becoming increasingly important, as one of the most important and noted skills for success in the 21st century. We offer a definition of creativity; and draw upon a systems model of creativity, to suggest creativity emerges and exists within a system, rather than only at the level of individual processes. We suggest that effective infusion of creativity and technology in education must be considered in a three-fold systemic manner: at the levels of teacher education, assessment and educational policy. We provide research and practical implications with broad recommendations across these three areas, to build discourse around infusion of creative thinking and technology in 21st century educational systems.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Currently, teacher educational systems tend to develop their teacher&rsquo;s knowledge to effectively integrate technology in teaching. Consequently, numerous studies have attempted to describe strategies, models and approaches to develop teachers&rsquo; knowledge for teaching with technology. However, most teachers are still following their traditional teaching methods regarding their cultural, individual and situational conditions. While teaching technology in traditional form and separated from pedagogy and content has already shown its failure in many studies, this study suggests an advanced directed instruction teaching model for preparing teachers for teaching with technology. In this study, directed instruction teaching model offers a step-by-step process to individually guide pre-service teachers how to infuse the appropriate technology for teaching the selected content. Subsequently, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is selected to define and measure technology integration. The result of this study demonstrated that participating teachers learned technology integration in the new directed setting as well as a constructivist setting. In particular, this study pointed out how the suggested directed instructional teaching model could be easily situated in the traditional setting and helped non-constructivist teacher educators in collaborative or individual learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study was conducted to find the effect of constructivism on technology integration knowledge in student-teachers. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) as a framework was selected to study and measure technology integration knowledge. The research sample included 22 student-teachers who were studying in the field of instructional technology in Islamic Azad University. The sample was selected from 174 students using a non-random sample selection method. In order to answer the research questions, a mixed method study was designed and the data were collected through multiple tools including TPACK questionnaire, interview, observation and note documents for the project. The data were analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of t-student test analysis showed a significant increase of TPACK in the participants. In addition, the findings that emerged from the qualitative data clarified in detail how constructivism activities enhanced the components of TPACK. Inter and intra group interactions among students and teacher along with the received feedback were found to be the most important activities to enhance TPACK, while learning by doing was found to be an effective activity that equips student-teachers for integrating technology in their teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This research has two main objectives. Firstly, to develop a causal model of teacher-education programs affecting the instructional design knowledge (and verification of the selected model for fitness for purpose). Secondly, to analyze the nature of direct effect on the mediation of teacher-education programs on instructional design knowledge, as well as the indirect effect mediation of TPACK framework knowledge with self-efficacy perception in the design of teaching programs. The samples consisted of 517 fifth-year student-teachers from universities within the Bangkok catchment area, drawn from a random sampling. The questionnaire for the design of teaching programs became the research instrument and the data were analyzed by Descriptive Statistics, Structural Equation Modeling Analysis (using LISREL Program). The findings included the following: 1) the model was appropriate for empirical data with Chi-Square value distribution (&chi;2 = 5.44; df = 8; p-value = .709) (which was statistically insignificant). Goo dness-of-Fit Index (GFI) value was .997 and the Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI) value was .988, indicating that the model was consistent with empirical data; 2) Causal Model of teacher-training programs affecting the design of instructional knowledge is the partial mediating research model. The design of instructional knowledge benefited directly from the experience gained through teacher-training programs (.34) and indirectly through the involvement of self-efficacy perception and TPACK framework knowledge (.54). All values are at .05 statistical significance level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of study is to examine the effectiveness of the computer and internet-supported science lesson in terms of pre-service science teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward computer and internet-based learning. Participants were forty-seven pre-service science teachers who were enrolled in the Computer class. The computer attitude scale and the attitude scale toward internet-based learning were used as data sources. The instruments were administrated to the pre-service science teachers at the beginning of the semester as pre-tests and again at the end of the semester as post-tests. Data gathered from pre-and post-administration were analyzed for each of the instruments. The results indicate that such learning experiences have positive effects on pre-service science teachers regarding enhancing more positive attitudes toward computer and internet-based learning and teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The aim of this study is to determine about the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) self confidence level of physics, chemistry, biology and science teachers and to analyze if the level of self&ndash;confidence changes according to gender, joining to a technological education before, branch, education level, worked institution and service period. Scanning method is used for the research. Working group of this research consists of 87 teachers from different institutions and branches. For data collection, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Self&ndash;Confidence Scale (TPACKSC), which is adapted to Turkish from original scale by Graham, Burgoyne, Cantrell, Smith &amp; Harris (2009) and tested for validity and reliability by Timur &amp; Tasar (2011), is preferred. As a result of the study, it is stated that teachers&rsquo; TPACK level is very high. On the other hand, it is seen that self-confidence level of teachers joined to research does not have a statically logical (p&gt;0.05) difference according to their sex, worked institution, joining to a technological education before and they have a statistical logical (p&lt;.05) difference related with the branch, service period, and education level.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Today, it is of great importance that teachers have pedagogical and technological knowledge in addition to content knowledge. For this reason, the present study aims to develop a TPACK self-efficacy scale for preservice science teachers by following the theoretical framework of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK), as suggested by Koehler and Mishra (2006). The scale consists of seven subscales, which are technology knowledge (TK), pedagogy knowledge (PK), content knowledge (CK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) with a total of 55 items. A total of 467 preservice science teachers from four different universities in Turkey participated in the study. The Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.969. Following the modification suggestions, confirmatory factor analyses showed that the model fit the scale adequately. The study found significant differences between the bottom and top groups; this shows the sufficiency of the items&rsquo; discriminatory powers. As the result of these analyses, it was found out that the scale had the necessary properties required for measuring the TPACK self-efficacy perceptions of preservice science teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examines the collaborative professional development (CPD) of three pairs of mentor teachers and pre-service teachers in a junior high school. Of particular focus is the integration of technology into instruction, by using technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to evaluate professional development. A qualitative research method based on classroom observations and focus group interviews (FGIs) is adopted. Additionally, data obtained from instructional plans, video-recorded classroom observations and FGIs are analyzed using a constant-comparison analysis method. Analysis results indicate that mentor teachers adjust their instruction methods when they receive the support of pre-service teachers specifically by moving from presenting technological content knowledge (TCK) to constructing various TCK bases. The pre-service teachers constantly apply TCK and technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) to develop professionally, especially in TPACK-related technology integration concepts. Notably, the CPD program benefits pre-service teachers more than mentor teachers because the former actively seek more opportunities to apply TPACK than the latter, who simply exchange digital instructional materials.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The flipped classroom model is an instructional model in which students learn basic subject matter knowledge prior to in-class meetings, then come to the classroom for active learning experiences. Previous research has shown that the flipped classroom model can motivate students towards active learning, can improve their higher-order thinking skills, and can improve their collaborative learning skills. However, most current studies focus on students&rsquo; experiences with flipped classroom learning. Because so few studies address the instructor&rsquo;s perspective, and instructors&rsquo; perspectives on technology integration can directly influence their practice of incorporating technology in instruction, this study sought to focus on instructors. This paper is a qualitative case study that reveals instructors&rsquo; experiences and perspectives on using the flipped classroom model in instruction. Structured interviews were conducted with eight faculty members who either previously had used or planned to use the flipped classroom model. Findings include instructors&rsquo; perceived definitions of the flipped classroom, how they improved teaching and learning by using the flipped classroom model, their perceived benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom, and perceived approaches of using it in an effective way. The participants also recommended peer assistance among instructors as valuable support to implement the flipped classroom model in instruction successfully.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Science simulations are popular among educators as such simulations afford for multiple visual representation and interactivity. Despite the popularity and abundance on the internet, our literature review suggested little research has been conducted on the use of simulation in elementary school. Thus, an exploratory pilot case study was conducted to address this research gap. In this study, an open source energy simulation was remixed for use in elementary school targeted at the Grade 4 &amp; 5 students as an after-school enrichment program. We proposed 3 stages: design, customization and implementation, to provide useful insights with the aim to allow other educators to conduct their own remixed simulation lessons. The simulation design principles (e.g., learning outcomes and colour coding) with the corresponding TPACK construct that emerged from the design and customization stages were reported. Such simulation design principles would be useful to interested educators and researchers who wish to adapt and use simulation or teach others how to remix simulation. Data from the multiple sources (e.g., field observations, surveys, design notes and existing simulations) indicated that students enjoyed learning with the remixed energy simulation.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Background: Technology represents a major topic in educational research. Nevertheless, a gap in the research remains concerning how teachers can bring technology into the classroom. This study focuses on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) framework, which aims to consolidate the multidisciplinary professional knowledge related to technology, pedagogy, and content that teachers need so that they can teach and students can learn effectively using technology tools. Purpose: The goal of the present study was to investigate the value of modification reflection prompts (&ldquo;think ahead&rdquo;) as a complementary reflective framework during the teacher preparatory program, beyond the more traditional judgment reflection prompts (&ldquo;think back&rdquo;). In particular, we examined how preservice science teachers may capitalize on learning from modification prompts versus judgment prompts versus both (&ldquo;think back&rdquo; and &ldquo;think ahead&rdquo;), compared with learning from generic prompts (&ldquo;stop and think&rdquo;) based on the IMPROVE model oriented to TPCK. We examined these four treatments&rsquo; effects on preservice teacher&rsquo; actual design of science lessons and development of their own self-reflection abilities. Participants: Participants were 199 first-year preservice science teachers in their preparatory programs at a university in central Israel. Research Design: We created a quasi-experimental opportunity for four groups of preservice science teachers to systematically contemplate ready-made TPCK-oriented lesson designs. Each used one of four different reflective methods (the independent variable): modification, judgment, combined modification + judgment, or generic prompts. Then we examined the differential contribution of these treatment methods to the two dependent variables: (1) preservice teachers&rsquo; skills for designing actual science lessons and (2) their judgment-type and modification-type self-reflection ability regarding the planning, monitoring, and evaluation phases of their lesson-design process. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were scored by coding schemes and were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up analyses of variance with repeated measures. Findings: Results indicated that preservice teachers who con templated a combination of both judgment and modification reflections in treatment improved more in their lesson-design skills and in their self-reflection ability (of both types at the three phases), compared with preservice teachers who contemplated only a single type of reflective prompt (generic or only judgment or modification). Lasting effects (after a semester without the IMPROVE model, prompts, or TPCK focus) revealed that the combined approach continued to significantly outperform the single approaches. Recommendations: The current study reinterprets the instructional-reflective framework of teacher education programs to include modification reflection too as a means of developing preservice teachers&rsquo; capacity to integrate technology in their lesson designs. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;There is a growing need for qualified online instructors to teach the expanding population of online K-12 students. To meet this need, teachers must be provided learning opportunities to acquire the specific types of knowledge and skills necessary to teach online. In this systematic review of the literature, we utilize the TPACK framework to aggregate the types of knowledge and skills required to teach online and examine both the extent to which these elements are addressed in existing programs and are based on empirical research. Findings suggest that the types of knowledge and skills based on empirical research originate from few studies and that most programs address only a small subset of knowledge and skills, varying greatly without uniformity in content or learning experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigated the conditions and situations offered by Experiencing Inquiry Model (EIM) for developing science teacher&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Also, the study explored the opportunities offered by EIM strategy in enhancing science teacher&rsquo;s abilities to design technology-based inquiry activities for science learning. Situated Cognitive Theory is used as a theoretical framework for learning, and TPACK is adapted to conceptualized technology integration. 17 science teachers from two schools participated in the study. The study employed a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative evidence. A paired sample t-Test was conducted on the participants&rsquo; pre- and post-Pathfinder networks. Concurrently, the qualitative evidence was collected from researcher&rsquo;s logbook, participants&rsquo; written documents, and interviews. The participants&rsquo; abilities to design technology-based inquiry activity for science learning were examined via Technology Integration Assessment Rubric (TIAR). The analysis of the Pathfinder networks showed that there were significant developments in the participants&rsquo; knowledge components embodied in TPACK. Nevertheless, the TIAR analysis suggested that the participants&rsquo; designs lacked connecting curriculum goals with technology, and compatibility with curriculum goals and instruction. The study suggested that science teachers should be given ample time to develop TPACK within their instructional contexts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This article includes reflections derived from exploratory research in databases, international journals on education and technology and book chapters that discuss the inter-relationship of different types of teachers knowledge. The goal was to understand the contributions and challenges of TPACK as an explanatory model of teacher action in decisions about the integration of technology in teaching practices. Among the contributions of the studies were highlighted research and experimentation supported by TPACK; TPACK as conductor of the initial and permanent education of teachers and the TPACK related with other theoretical models. The model TPACK was considered knowledge base for teaching the integration of technologies in educational contexts, from alignment with pedagogical approaches and teaching specific content. However, some challenges were identified by the studies, such as the difficulty of consensus to define each construct of the model; the need to define the types of technologies embraced by TPACK and fragility in the process of measuring TPACK. The expectation of this article is to propose weightings and reflections that can mobilize the continuity and development of the subject investigated.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;One of the challenges facing education systems in general and the South African education system in particular is how to understand ways that teachers change from nonusers of technologies to becoming transformative teachers with technology. Despite numerous initiatives, not limited to training, workshops and so forth, to bring about sustained and wide‐spread teacher change, transmission/delivery‐based pedagogies and chalk‐and‐talk methods continue to dominate. While policy directives and professional development programmes aim to effect change in teachers&rsquo; practice, they tend to fail to create sustainable change in teachers&rsquo; practice of using emerging technologies (ETs). This paper reports on a study that sought to understand how teachers change their pedagogy of teaching with ETs. Using a Design‐Based Research approach, the paper reports on the teachers&rsquo; pedagogical change framework (Teaching Change Frame ‐TCF) as a diagnostic tool for locating and mapping how teachers&rsquo; change. The TCF maps teachers&rsquo; existing pedagogies and ET uses, and designs a pathway of a change process to affect the desired change. The TCF was tested and refined using data from 325 teachers drawn from rural, resource‐constrained schools, urban, well‐resourced schools and from preservice teaching students in a decontextualized environment. Following three iterations it was found that teachers&rsquo; use of ETs in regulated, restrictive ways correlate with transmission pedagogies, unregulated, dispersed ways correlate with transformative pedagogies. The use of TCF not only located teaching pedagogies but also provide different pathways to ensure sustainable change. Findings emphasize the need for teachers to encourage learners to build/create/construct with ETs and for increased interaction in fostering nonregulated dispersed use of ETs.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Mastering content vocabulary is critical to the success of students with high-incidence disabilities in the general education curriculum. General education classrooms often do not offer the opportunities necessary for these students to master important vocabulary. Teachers often look to technology to help. Several studies have indicated that content acquisition podcasts (CAPs) may have an impact on the vocabulary learning of secondary students with high-incidence disabilities. In this study, 37 in-service teachers enrolled in a master&rsquo;s program in special education were taught to create CAPs for vocabulary terms in a course focused on methods for secondary-level instruction. Teacher-created podcasts were assessed on the presence of Mayer&rsquo;s instructional design principles as well as evidence-based practices for vocabulary instruction. Although teachers were able to include many instructional design principles related to technology in their CAPs, their use of instructional principles and evidence-based practices was inconsistent. Implications are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The appropriate selection and implementation of technology in instruction is made possible by teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). The TPACK that inservice teachers develop is practitioner-based and can be continuously transformed with teaching experiences. In this study, we constructed video-embedded and discipline-focused questionnaires to measure science teachers&rsquo; TPACK. Item sets were generic across four disciplines and designed to investigate teachers&rsquo; TPACK at different levels of the cognitive process. Each questionnaire was embedded with three instructional clips in which preservice teachers demonstrated their previously-prepared lessons on selected topics in biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Through exploratory factor analysis, four factors (i.e., evaluation, evaluation/synthesis, application/analysis, and knowledge/comprehension) emerged from the data. The presumed hierarchical interrelationships among these cognitive processes were investigated through a path analysis. The findings indicated that teachers&rsquo; TPACK at the knowledge/comprehension level made significant loadings to TPACK at higher levels, but this was not the case for application/analysis. The disconnect for application/analysis within the simple-to-complex cognitive process hierarchy suggests that it should be viewed as different from the other three constructs that incorporate more instructional reasoning. The designs for the questionnaire items and embedded instructional clips that were used to elicit practical knowledge and prompt teachers to respond are presented herein.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This chapter explores the concepts of Learning Design (LD) and Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) in an attempt to contribute greater clarity about their epistemological and conceptual similarities and differences. Drawing on LD and TPACK research, we present a conceptual framework that helps to analyze LD and TPACK philosophy and application, specifically targeting designers of teaching and learning activities, educational researchers and administrators. A key goal of this chapter is to illustrate that, although the concepts operate in different paradigms and are designed for a different target audience, they are complementary. The LD construct based on the Learning Design Framework (LD-F) introduced in the Larnaca Declaration is focusing on pedagogical design and is underpinned by the ideas of interdisciplinary, general applicability and flexibility in epistemology and ontology, whereas TPACK is specifically targeted to the education of schoolteachers, providing a framework that illustrates the relationship between the three components of TPACK. Understanding their complementary nature will assist designers of learning and teaching to make better-informed decisions about technology-enhanced learning and teaching provisions.&rdquo;</p>

When viewed through the lens of the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), data suggest a technology-mediated shift in pedagogy in the area of differentiation in instruction and assessment in mathematics classrooms. Future implications regarding technology integration, professional development programs, and the use of the TPACK as a descriptive tool are considered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study combines research in the area of adaptive learning environments with the LMS area by analyzing the design process of personalized courses in Learning Activity Management System (LAMS). Postgraduate students used LAMS to design and personalize courses. The way personalization is introduced in the courses is analyzed based on the source of adaptation, the adaptation method, and the adaptability opportunities. The added value of this process for the authors&ndash;designers is explored by analyzing students&rsquo; artifacts based on criteria that match the various knowledge types proposed by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. Moreover, the appropriateness and adequacy of the available tools by which adaptation can be implemented in LAMS are evaluated. Results provide evidence about the potential of designing personalized lessons in cultivating various types of knowledge such as pedagogical and technological but also their combination, the technological pedagogical knowledge. This work also provided evidence about the potential of LAMS in supporting adaptivity and proposals about possible extensions of the environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper investigates the views of compulsory education science (PE04) teachers regarding the B-Level professional development programme (PDP) and what it offers in terms of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge, and their readiness to apply it in the classroom. The views of 59 teachers from 7 in-service teacher training centres were surveyed using specially developed Likert-type questionnaires, while semi-structured interviews with a sample group of 8 teachers provided supplementary in-depth data. The teachers&rsquo; views were for the most part positive for aspects of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model that were provided by the professional development programme, while 17&ndash;30 % reported moderate satisfaction. Their views of the skills they acquired relating to the incorporation of ICT in teaching activities were roughly similar, with certain differences. Given the limitations of the research, these results indicate, in our view, that the structure and implementation of the B-Level programme for compulsory education science teachers promote the development of teachers&rsquo; knowledge and skills and that there is still room for improvement.&rdquo;</p>

This chapter presents a framework for supporting in-service teachers to integrate these technologies. The research team derived this framework from data collected during an extended TPACK-style (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) workshop that engaged 13 life science community college instructors in integrating bioinformatics technologies into courses. This chapter presents a case study about the challenges community college teachers faced in implementing these tools&mdash;and the strategies they used to address them.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This research study was designed to explore the potential connections between teachers&rsquo; contexts and their instruction. Specifically, I explored how teachers perceived contextual influences on technology-related instructional decisions in secondary social studies classrooms. I defined teachers&rsquo; contexts as comprised of curricular, interpersonal, and organizational or institutional factors existing on three organizational layers, described as macro, meso, and micro. Through a multiple case study design and interpretivist perspective, I studied three cases of individual social studies teachers working in the shared environment of one high school. I viewed the teachers as curricular-instructional gatekeepers (Thornton, 2005) working in a contested classroom space (Craig, 2009). Through this lens, data generation took place at the classroom level and included interviews, observations, and artifact analysis. Data analysis was structured by the Information Ecologies framework (Nardi &amp; O&rsquo;Day, 1999) to provide a consistent approach for analysis of teachers&rsquo; decision-making within and across cases. Study findings revealed multiple contextual influences that varied in significance across cases depending on the educational orientation of each teacher. Teachers&rsquo; contexts and individual educational orientations aligned to varying degrees and resulted in unique curricular-instructional gatekeeping in each case. Accordingly, instructional decision-making regarding the use of educational technology was inconsistent across cases despite the shared environment in which the three teachers worked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Despite the rapid expansion of mobile technologies in K-12 schools, recent research has shown that many teachers are ill prepared to take advantage of these new tools. This study was designed to address the problem of lack of effective iPad integration in primary classrooms at an international school in South Korea. The purpose of this case study was to examine primary teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the implementation of an iPad initiative begun in 2012. Framed by Koehler and Mishra&rsquo;s technological pedagogical content knowledge model (TPACK), the study was guided by research questions that involved teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the barriers, challenges, and successes regarding iPad implementation in the primary classroom. A purposeful sample of 5 K-2 teachers who use iPads in the classroom was chosen. The case study design entailed semi-structured interviews, classroom observations of each participant, and examination of teachers&rsquo; lesson plans. Data were coded and analyzed using inductive analysis based on components of a conceptual logic model. Credibility and trustworthiness were ensured through member checking and triangulation of data. Results showed lack of experience, collegial support, and iPad-specific training as barriers and future preparation for teachers as a challenge. Successes were demonstrated through formative assessments and digital portfolios. The resulting project was a comprehensive professional development plan to provide primary teachers with the knowledge and skills to implement technology in the classroom and ongoing support to develop a professional technology learning network. In terms of broad social change, this research and project might provide insight to better prepare educators to make the best use of integrated learning technologies for efficient and effective teaching and learning in classrooms.&rdquo;</p>

Technology and preservice teacher education: A mixed-methods study of technology integration by arts and sciences faculty into secondary education content courses (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10162717)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In spite of initiatives design to address the integration of technology into teaching and the billions of dollars spent to fund these initiatives, there is still a gap in the research on the extent to which teacher education programs prepare preservice teachers to integrate technology into teaching (Kleiner et al, 2007; Abbitt &amp; Klett, 2007). While Schools, Colleges, and Departments of Education are required to address technology integration for accreditation, how and when technology is address is left to the discretion of each institution. Because pre-service secondary education students typically take the majority of their courses outside of the College of Education, teacher preparation programs have a stake in technology use among Arts and Sciences faculty.</p>
<p>This mixed-methods study used the Higher Education-Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (HE-TPACK) survey to examine perceptions of Arts and Sciences faculty who teach content courses for pre-service secondary education majors at a southeastern research university. The HE-TPACK addressed eight domains of technology training (TT), pedagogy knowledge (PK), technology knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK), pedagogy content knowledge (PCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content Knowledge (TCK), and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). Interviews were conducted to create a more in depth picture of technology use in the teaching practices of Arts and Sciences faculty. Looking through a theoretical lens of transformative learning, interview participants were asked about their experiences with technology, opportunities they provide for their students to integrate technology through assignments, and any transformative experiences that caused them to view technology in a different way.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of this study, many faculty overestimate their HE-TPACK abilities. While many faculty still view technology as a production or communication skill, there were specific examples of transformative experiences that changed the way certain individuals address technology for student learning. This agrees with previous research that modeling technology integration helps teachers feel more comfortable and better prepared to teach with technology (Whipp, Schewiezer, &amp; Dooley, 2001; Kayne-Chaplock, Whipp, &amp; Schwiezer 2004). Because of their own transformative experiences, these faculty members were able to facilitate a transformative learning experience for their students (Jang &amp; Chen, 2010).&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Universities are increasingly concerned with providing a high-quality student<br />experience; good teaching is a key component. The area of Learning Design aims to<br />provide effective, high-quality models to support university teachers in achieving this<br />goal. Research to date on Learning Designs has focused on the development of tools,<br />technical standards, potential needs, and attitudes towards use, with few studies<br />investigating university teachers&rsquo; actual use of Learning Designs. Little is known,<br />therefore, about how teachers apply Learning Designs to real design problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore how university teachers use Learning Designs<br />as part of their routine design work with real students in naturalistic design contexts<br />throughout a full cycle of planning, implementation, and review. Through rich case<br />accounts and analysis of university teachers&rsquo; work, this study provides new insights into<br />the nature of design work supported by Learning Designs. This research is important because building and developing Learning Designs requires an understanding of their effective integration into the design process.</p>
<p>A multiple case study approach was used to provide a holistic, rich quote of eight<br />university teachers&rsquo; design work and Learning Designs use for a semester-long<br />undergraduate unit. The study was underpinned by a theoretical framework that<br />conceptualises teachers&rsquo; design work using concepts from design thinking and the<br />Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework to conceptualise teacher<br />knowledge. Data was collected before, during, and after the semester using interviews,<br />documents, stimulated recall, and researcher observations to provide a detailed picture<br />of university teachers&rsquo; work with Learning Designs. Each of the cases was analysed in<br />multiple, iterative phases, resulting in eight rich case descriptions that reveal the key<br />phases of design work and Learning Designs use.</p>
<p>Additionally, cross-case analyses were conducted to identify key characteristics of<br />design thinking and practice and Learning Designs use across each of the design phases;<br />the relationships between Learning Designs use and key case attributes; and impacts on<br />university teachers&rsquo; design work in the areas of technology, pedagogy, and content. The findings show that the design processes using Learning Designs were student focused,<br />multi-phased, iterative, and ongoing throughout implementation. Participants<br />used Learning Designs in four key ways: to benchmark their pedagogical practice;<br />model and stimulate pedagogical ideas; guide design steps; and document and<br />communicate design plans. Learning Designs acted variously as a framework for<br />thinking and making design thinking visible, particularly for those who created design<br />artefacts using Learning Design ideas and conceptualisations. Learning Design use was also reported to result in a greater awareness of links between the areas of pedagogy,<br />content and technology providing a pattern of evidence supporting pedagogical content<br />knowledge development for designers of new units and technological pedagogical<br />content knowledge development for participants making changes to previously run<br />units.</p>
<p>The results of this investigation provide new knowledge about university teachers&rsquo;<br />design work using Learning Designs, and their impacts before, during, and after<br />teaching. The outcomes of this research provide evidence that can be used by university<br />administrators, educational designers, university teachers, and Learning Designs tool<br />developers. The complex and ongoing nature of participants&rsquo; design work suggests that<br />university teachers need tools to support design thinking throughout all stages of design<br />work. This includes tools that will allow flexibility and openness for ongoing design<br />work. The findings also point to a deeper role for Learning Designs in the support and<br />development of university teachers&rsquo; design thinking and knowledge integration than has<br />previously been shown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examines the use of ICT by teachers Cameroonian secondary schools. This study explores the pedagogical use of ICT in the teaching and the learning process, the impact of its use and the role school principals and the community plays in enhancing ICT in the pedagogy. This is a qualitative case study of two public secondary schools in the South West Region of Cameroon consisting of interviews and observations. A total of 24 participants comprising of 20 teachers, two school principals and two parents responded to semi-structured interview questions. Also, observational study was also carried out to examine the various pedagogical practices of ICT in both schools. All the interview data were all transcribed and interpreted using the participants&rsquo; quotes as examples and evidence of the findings. Pictures were used to analyse observational data whereby moments related to the pedagogic use of ICT in the classroom and other areas in the schools under study were captured and described to strengthen the findings. The TPACK model was used to examine the teacher&rsquo;s knowledge in the pedagogic use of ICT Findings in this study indicated that pedagogic use of ICT is still in its preliminary stages as 16 out of the 20 teachers were passively using ICT in their classroom and an additional two teachers were non-users of ICT in their pedagogic activities.Also, there were no significant changes in the teachers&rsquo; position as a result of the pedagogic use of ICT in the classrooms. 2 out of the 18 teachers who considered themselves as active pedagogic users of ICT were still using the traditional instructional method of teaching even though ICT tools were present in the classrooms. Inadequate ICT training for teachers in their subject area acted as a major challenge for teachers from both schools to integrate ICT in their subject areas. Therefore ICT was still used as an add-on rather than an integrated tool in the teaching and learning process. The majority of the teachers acknowledge positive changes ICT had left in the teaching and learning process. Also, findings from this study reveal that the school principals and parents had little influence over the use of ICT in the pedagogy. It is evident from this study that for teachers to successfully integrate ICT in their classrooms, the teacher pre-service and in-service courses have to technologically drive to ensure effective use of ICT in the pedagogy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology integration in the curriculum remains a challenge at different levels in the education system. In one Caribbean 4-year college, faculty are expected to prepare preservice teachers to integrate technology in classroom instruction. When preservice teachers are not prepared for technology integration, interventions are necessary to address this challenge of technology integration. The purpose of this qualitative bounded intrinsic case study was to gain an understanding of the process of technology integration by instructors at the research site. Davies&rsquo; theory for understanding technological literacy and the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge model conceptually framed this study. A purposeful sample of 13 instructors who integrated technology in their curricula and volunteered to participate were observed, interviewed, and provided documentation to explore how they integrated technology in their courses. Data were coded typologically using a priori codes and inductively to identify major themes regarding instructors&rsquo; challenges and perceptions of technology integration. Instructors were consistent in their integration of technology, increased technology use when they held a positive view of technology, and did not use sufficient web-based tools. They expressed a need for additional technology integration training, because there is an absence of training opportunities offered in the area of technology integration. Based on these findings, a 3-day technology integration workshop was created for the instructors. These endeavors may contribute to positive social change by empowering instructors to adopt pedagogy that can transform the college classroom environment and can support instructors&rsquo; teaching and learning, thus, preparing preservice teachers to embrace technology in their classrooms.&rdquo;</p>

The specific objectives are: designing, creating and incorporating didactic materials from enriched e-book following TPACK model; identifying the usefulness of enriched e-book in information processing and digital competence and, finally, assessing whether the enriched e-book improves the informative production in students. The methodological design used is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest model combining the TPACK model to implement didactic units and activities about Media Education, through the educational use of the e-book EC resource. 53 students have participate from 11 to 12 years old, 11 teachers and 28 families from a public school. The instrument has been the questionnaire to collect information by Likert type with five intervals for 78 items numerically from 0 to 4 distributed in 14 dimensions through which we wanted to collect the assessment of learning level of the three main dimension: level of Media Literacy, level of collaborative learning and the assessment of the digital tool e-book EC. The main conclusions: 1. It has been able to design, to create and to incorporate the e-book EC in an integrative model of Media Education in Primary Education. 2. The e-book EC facilitates collaborative learning based on the creation of knowledge through the interaction and inter-individual, by managing digital resources focused on improving Media Education, which has facilitated the improvement in the autonomous and thoughtful development of students. 3. It is significant starting from low levels, the positive differential average pretest-posttest, of each of the three dimensions covering all its dimensions: Media Literacy 48.43%, 48.56% collaborative learning and evaluation of e-book EC 67.66%, because they show ourselves the absurdity not to develop this disciplinary field as soon as possible. 4.

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The study aimed at formulating a strategy to improve teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for teaching Euclidean geometry with the aid of integrated information and communication technology (ICT) software. TPACK refers to the interaction of three knowledge domains, which are, technology, pedagogy and content knowledge. The three knowledge domains further intersect to form subsets, which are, technological content knowledge; technological pedagogical knowledge; and pedagogical content knowledge. The three knowledge domains, together with the subsets, were used to define knowledge needed for teaching with the aid of technology. Furthermore, in the context of this study, integrated ICT software tools that were employed in teaching Euclidean geometry as teaching aids were Geometer&rsquo;s Sketchpad, GeoGebra and HeyMath!. The study pursued the challenges that teachers face when they use ICT software as a teaching aid; these challenges included the following: Some teachers experience difficulties keeping up with rapidly advancing software knowledge; and the majority of teachers lack sufficient knowledge and skills to explore the potential of ICT software fully. In addition, part of the problem is that teachers found Euclidean geometry too abstract and difficult to teach. Thus, the study was geared to formulating a strategy to respond to these challenges. However, the challenge is that the knowledge needed for teaching is contextually bound and complex. Thus, the study adopted bricolage as a theoretical lens for the study, mainly due to its critical commitment to making meaning of complex objects of study in their contexts. In this study, bricolage enabled me to consider a theoretical stance from the eight historical moments of qualitative research. Through the multiplicity of theoretical lenses provided by bricolage I was able to unravel the multi-layered challenges and formulate a multi-layered strategy. The multi-layered strategy was made possible by people who came together, with diverse back stories, knowledge and skills. In this study mathematics teachers who are faced with the day-to-day challenges of teaching Euclidean geometry with the aid of ICT software embarked on research to solve their own challenges. Driven by its epistemological stance on knowledge production, participatory action research created a platform for teachers, academics, and a computer programmer to engage in knowledge production activities with equality and tolerance of contrasting views. Various data generation tools were employed, ranging from audio and video recordings, learners&rsquo; scripts and data from their test scores. In order to deepen the meaning of spoken and written text, the study employed Van Dijk&rsquo;s critical discourse analysis at three levels, namely, text, discursive practices and social structures. Furthermore, learners&rsquo; test scores were analysed using statistical techniques, such as boxplot, analysis of variance and statistical modelling. The study analysed the challenges experienced by teachers who teach Euclidean geometry with the aid of integrated ICT software. This was done for the purpose of proposing possible solutions and strategies that can be developed, adopted and adapted to address the challenges teachers experienced effectively. In addition, for the purpose of sustainability of the strategy formulated to improve teachers&rsquo; TPACK during and beyond the duration of the study, the conditions conducive for the strategy were investigated. The study analysed threats and risks that were embedded or inherited in the setting, to prevent them from impeding the successful implementation of the strategy. The study is transformative in nature, which created the opportunity to operationalise and evaluate the success of the strategy prior to it being considered for recommendation. Finally, some of the major findings were that teachers work in silos; and that they do not prepare sufficiently when they use ICT software as a teaching aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The literature indicates that when mobile devices are implemented in conjunction with content and sound pedagogical strategies, they can support flexibility and student choice, personalized and differentiated instruction, twenty-first century skills, and improved student outcomes. Research has yet to explore iPad integration given unlimited one-to-one access. The purpose of this study is to describe the pedagogical practices of teachers in a one-to-one iPad initiative in a private school for boys in the Mid-Atlantic region. Specifically, three questions are guiding this work: (1) To what degree are iPads integrated into the teaching and learning processes at Saint Edmond&rsquo;s Academy? (2) How did teachers integrate apps into their instruction, given long-term and unlimited access to iPads?, and (3) What are teachers&rsquo; beliefs with regard to the benefits and drawbacks of using mobile technology in the classroom?</p>
<p>The study investigates how nine teachers in grades six through eight integrate the technology with their content and pedagogy. Each teacher participated in two rounds of data collection. Data were collected through written lesson plans, classroom observations and teacher interviews. Each piece of data collected assessed the teacher&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Lesson plans submitted by the nine teachers were developed using the TPACK lesson plan template. Rubrics based on this framework were used to score lesson plans, classroom observations, and interviews.<br />Findings indicate that teachers in the one-to-one iPad Initiative understand how to plan for lessons that incorporate technology, content and pedagogy. The study also describes how teachers integrate more than eighteen different apps with the content and pedagogy of their lessons, develop students&rsquo; 21st century skills, and use apps to support student flexibility and choice in a lesson. This study also found that teachers believe integrating the iPads enables them to create lessons that provide flexibility and choice, to give students instant access to information, and to allow teachers to take on a different role in the lesson.</p>
<p>This study provides valuable input that will serve as a resource when drawing further guidelines for continuing, improving or expanding iPad mobile learning initiatives.&rdquo;</p>

This need, as recognized by the European Commission, clearly requires a concerned research effort in preparing future teachers with necessary skills to integrate emerging ICTs into learning and teaching settings. This research aims to respond to the need for developing technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) informed curriculum materials and research assessment instruments that will be use by the teacher educators to develop and assess preservice teachers&rsquo; knowledge of &ldquo;effective mobile application integration&rdquo;-defined as mobile-TPACK in this research. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The use of ICT in pedagogy has a positive impact on the teaching and learning<br />process. While ICT in pedagogy is an undertaking involving stakeholders like teachers, administrators and students, teachers are considered to play a core role in the use of ICT in pedagogy. What factors will then make the teachers use ICT in pedagogy? In deriving the factors affecting the adoption of an innovation, such as ICT in pedagogy, several frameworks are available. Of these frameworks, we review some of the traditional innovation adoption frameworks namely, the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, and the Unified Theory of<br />Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). We find that all the above models have been widely employed in guiding innovation adoption studies. We notably argue that the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework can be included on the list of innovation adoption models. Thirdly, we review past studies on TPACK and isolate pertinent gaps. Hence we develop a framework basing on TPACK, and derive hypotheses to guide further studies on the factors related to the use of ICT in pedagogy by teachers and call for a paradigm shift to have large scale quantitative studies testing whether the TPACK constructs relate to the levels of use of ICT in pedagogy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In recent years, educational technologies have become an essential tool used to engage and improve student learning of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) content. The increasing use of technology in education to promote effective pedagogy of STEM content has led to the development of the conceptual framework of &ldquo;technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge&rdquo;, also known as TPACK.1 This framework emphasizes teachers&rsquo; use of educational technologies to improve student understanding of content that imposes pedagogical challenges. The TPACK framework is derived from the interactions between three knowledge domains: technology-, pedagogy-, and content-knowledge. In the context of TPACK, technology encompasses technological products and the knowledge, skills, tools, and processes needed to design, build, and operate these products.2,3 Pedagogy refers to principles and techniques of conducting and assessing effective teaching and learning. Finally, content refers to fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and knowledge connections and arrangements useful in classroom environment.4 An intentional application of the TPACK framework can facilitate effective pedagogy through technology integration by making use of the interactions among the three underlying knowledge domains. Thus, for teachers to make effective use of this framework, they require the knowledge of the disciplinary content, as well as an understanding of the educational technology and its practical applications in education.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This presentation will focus on the connection between pedagogy, technology and content knowledge. The presenters will show how each area (pedagogy, technology and content knowledge) are linked to the other to provide best practices through the development of e-learning modules such as e-books and mobile apps. The presenters will provide a demonstration of an e-book, mobile app and the accessibility features the eTextlink platform provides for the content. Also, a demonstration of how these teaching and learning strategies are incorporated into a traditional and online class will follow. Educational opportunities are enhanced through greater accessibility via online curricula and various e-Learning formats. While an instructor can teach using proper pedagogy, technology can be used to make learning accessible for all. It takes a collaboration of both worlds to make the learning experience truly great. By leveraging the right technology an instructor can make sure the content can be accessed by everyone who needs and wants it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excerpt: &ldquo;I like the TPACK framework for its combination of three important teaching competencies. It&rsquo;s useful as a tool for discussion, self-assessment, and growth; but like any model it doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. Two recent experiences in my AP US History class highlight this for me:<br />&bull; In one lesson, after discussing westward migration in the antebellum United States, students played the classic Oregon Trail video game. We ended by talking about the many risks of the westward journey and evaluating how accurately the game portrayed them. It was a lot of fun and a fairly successful mix of technology, content, and pedagogy.<br />&bull; A few days earlier, as a review of antebellum society, students stepped into character for a &ldquo;speed dating&rdquo; activity. They held short conversations with other characters from the era and judged who would be their most likely friends among the group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study presents the development and application of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) for blended learning environment (BLE) to a university located in rural area of the Philippines with limited technological resources for online learning. Each element of TPACK model was used as a guide in the development of teaching plan for blended learning environment. A randomized pretest and posttest quasi-experimental research design was used in this experiment to determine the significant difference on the posttest sores of the experimental and control group in terms of their achievement test in Computer Fundamentals. Participants of the study consisted 90 freshmen Bachelor of Science in Information Technology students, 45 students each comprising the experimental and control group. An item-analyzed multiple-choice achievement test floated before and after the experiment. Result revealed successful integration of technology in a technology-deprived university using TPACK model for BLE. In terms of student learning, results revealed that both the experimental and control group slightly increased their mean score using the blended learning approach and traditional teaching inside the classroom which concludes that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control group after the TPACK experiment as compared to the control group exposed to the traditional approach of teaching, hence it is recommended to continuously focus on PCK to further improve the TPACK model for BLE for school in rural areas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In 2045, Indonesia is determined to have a golden generation in order to improve the nation&rsquo;s competitiveness. However, in reality the condition of teenagers today is very alarming. The data show about 93 out of 100 elementary school students have already consumed pornography; about 21 out of 100 young women have abortions; some 135 teenagers become victims of violence every day; 5 out of 100 adolescents contract sexually transmitted diseases; 63 out of 100 teens have sex before marriage. School teachers should take active roles in minimizing such unhappy figure and prepare the golden generation. This article proposes local culture and local moral to complete the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK+) within the challenge of the 21st century skills. The objectives are to provide pre-service English Teachers at Universitas PGRI Semarang and pre-service English teachers in general with the ability to develop English course content in the students&rsquo; cultural context as well as local characters and to equip the pre-service teachers with the 21st century skills. The subjects were 345 pre-service English Teachers who took the TEFL, Teaching Media, and ESP Courses during the academic year of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. The data were collected through observation, teaching practice, and self-evaluation. The results show 84.92% of the students were included under the category of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;very good&rdquo; in pedagogical skills, 77.38 % in pedagogical content knowledge, and 87.53 % in cultural and local wisdom context in content development, but only 51.58% in technological knowledge. For improving technological knowledge of the pre-service students, there should be more training on the use of technology before and during the process of teaching and learning of pre-service English teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;ICT provides an array of powerful tools that induce transformation from a teacher-centred to a student-focused and interactive knowledge environment. The use of ICT in pedagogy opens up opportunities for learning because it enables learners to access, extend, transform and share ideas and information in multi-modal communication styles and formats. Therefore, all efforts to enhance it should be expended. One way of enhancing the use of ICT in pedagogy is to isolate the factors that underpin it. It is with this understanding that, basing on the Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, this paper proposes a positivist study to examine the extent to which knowledge relates with the use of ICT in pedagogy among teachers of mathematical disciplines at Makerere University.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper explored the effects of in-class-level differentiation by making innovative use of an interactive whiteboard (SMARTboard) on math proficiency. Therefore, this paper evaluates the use of SMARTboard in class, in combination with teacher training, using a randomized field experiment among 199 pre-vocational students in seventh grade in the Netherlands. During 6 weeks, students in the intervention group participated in math classes in which the SMARTboard was used to apply level differentiation. The teachers of these classes received a specific training (Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge [TPACK]) in using the SMARTboard in class. Control classes were taught by teachers without the training, who did not use the SMARTboard in class. The results showed that level differentiation in class, which was possible because of the efficient use of the SMARTboard, significantly increased math proficiency with 0.25 points.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It seems to be a must for teachers and pre-service teachers to have information and skills necessary for the use of technology in education. This requires effective planning of how technology should be integrated into the teacher training curriculums of education faculties and continuous revision of this plan. In this regard, the purpose of the current study is to investigate the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge in relation to grade level and gender variables. The current study employing the survey model was conducted on 136 first and third year students from the Classroom Teacher Education Department of the Education Faculty at Mugla Sitki Kocman University in the fall term of 2015-2016 academic year. As a data collection tool, a 47-item, 7-factor and five-point Likert type Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Scale was used. The collected data were analyzed with independent samples t-test. The findings of the test revealed that the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge and opinions about the sub-factors do not vary significantly depending on gender and grade level; however, their opinions about the sub-factor of technological knowledge vary significantly depending on grade level.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;When electronic portfolios (e-portfolios) are employed as summative assessments for degree granting programs, it is imperative that graduate students demonstrate their knowledge in the field to showcase learning growth and achievement of the program learning outcomes. This study examined the extent master&rsquo;s degree students in the field of educational technology demonstrated their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) related elements in their e-portfolio reflection, when they were guided by TPACK framework grounded instruction. Using content analysis technique and open-ended survey responses, the findings show that graduate students were able to demonstrate their interconnected technological pedagogical knowledge in their reflection to justify their competencies. In addition, graduate students had positive reactions to the opportunity to reflect through writing the reflection paper. This study contributes to the eportfolio literature by signifying the importance of providing a discipline-specific framework to guide students&rsquo; reflection of learning. The TPACK grounded instruction helped graduate students stay focused on their reflection. This study also contributes to the TPACK literature by demonstrating the extent to which graduate students presented their integrated knowledge of TPACK at the end of a program driven to developing students&rsquo; technology integration expertise.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The use of technology in instruction has brought about different perceptions. The need to know how teachers integrate technology in instruction has brought about different views. Therefore, this study mainly seeks to understand these views on lecturers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) perceptions, as it examines how their views differ according to gender, employment status, department and the state of in-service training oriented towards the use of technology. In order to achieve the above stated aim, the researcher statistically examined Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU) Faculty of Education lecturers&rsquo; TPACK perceptions. In this research, a TPACK survey instrument was administered to 53 lecturers, and a questionnaire was used to ascertain their perception levels across the seven TPACK dimensions. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, frequency and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test) were used for data analysis. The study reveals that lecturers&rsquo; perceptions of TPACK were significantly high across all knowledge dimensions and there were statistically significant differences on how lecturers viewed TPACK according to the above listed variables. These differences occurred in Technological Knowledge (TK) and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) according to gender; Technological Knowledge (TK) and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK) according to employment status; Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) according to department, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) according to in-service training.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Individual characteristics of people such as approach to technology, knowledge level and perceptions come into prominence. Rogers is classified individuals in five different categories (innovators, early adaptors, early majority, late majority, laggards) in terms of their innovation characteristics and states them as individual innovativeness. Having an individual innovativeness level is a factor which not only may influence people&rsquo;s skills concerning use of technology but also may influence teachers&rsquo; technological integration level in the class. This study aims to determine the effect of teachers&rsquo; individual innovativeness level on technological integration process. In line with this purpose, TPACK self-efficacies scale and individual innovativeness scale have been applied to 421 teachers employed in Turkey in 2013-2014 education years. Teachers&rsquo; individual innovativeness levels, TPACK skill conditions and predictive power level of individual innovativeness on TPACK skills have been researched. As a result of this research, it has been understood that a great majority of teachers consider themselves as early majority and early adaptors as well as being advanced level in terms of TPACK skills. In addition it has been concluded that there is a positive and important relationship between individual innovativeness and TPACK, while individual innovativeness becomes an important predictor of TPACK skills.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK is a framework for the learning process in which educators combine Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge to deliver the learning experience. Therefore, TPACK can be defined as a complex interaction between the technology, pedagogy and content. TPACK expresses the overlap between these factors in a two dimensional space, placing TPACK at the centre. Educators can place their teaching episode within this space and ask, if I place my delivery at this point is it the best point in the TPACK space? Secondly educators may ask how can the best point within the space be determined? The CPT model proposes an attempt to address these questions by recasting TPACK as a three dimensional pseudo-vector space allowing expected outcomes and observed outcomes to be analysed. For the study presented here our null hypothesis is: H0 = there is no significant difference between the observed and expected outcomes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The technological pedagogical content knowledge framework is increasingly in use by educational technology researcher as a generic quote of the knowledge requirements for teachers using technology in all subjects. This study describes the development of a mathematics specific variety of the technological pedagogical content knowledge framework. The paper showed how a particular conception of the knowledge required to teach mathematics can be integrated with the technological pedagogical content knowledge framework as the basis for understanding technology integrated mathematics teaching. The resulting framework provides a sharper lens than the generic technological pedagogical content knowledge framework alone and a better understanding of the knowledge required for teachers of mathematics to use technology in their teaching. The study illustrated how the framework may be useful for analysing the knowledge demands of particular mathematics teaching tasks, and for planning appropriate professional development for integrating technology in the teaching of mathematics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This article reports on a qualitative case study which examined the development of six Australian pre-service teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK), through a series of six semi-structured interviews, over the duration of their four-year teacher preparation programme. Consistent with the research design employed, detailed quote is used to provide an insightful picture of the knowledge and skills gained. The results indicate a clear progression in the development of TPACK in these pre-service teachers. For some this was more pronounced than for others, a range of identified aspects of their preparation experience impacting on their development. The extent of ICT use on professional placement, expectations and practice of supervising teachers, school culture and resourcing were major identified influences. A range of aspects of university preparation including an ICT skill and pedagogy subject, assignments and lecturer modelling also had an evident effect on the growth of the pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Using the Game-based-learning Teaching Belief Scale (GTBS) and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge&mdash;Games questionnaire (TPACK-G), this study investigated 316 Taiwanese in-service teachers&rsquo; teaching beliefs about game-based learning and their perceptions of game-based pedagogical content knowledge (GPCK). Both t-tests and ANOVA analyses were used to examine the differences due to their demographic backgrounds. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the predicting variables of the teachers&rsquo; GPCK. The results showed that, among the factors of GTBS and TPACK-G, GPK plays the most critical role in predicting GPCK. In addition, the elementary school teachers had h5er Belief, Confidence and Motivation for using game-based teaching approaches, and had higher GPK and GPCK than middle school teachers. A gender difference only existed in GK. Younger teachers had better GK and GCK than older teachers. Compared with experienced teachers, novice teachers tended to believe that digital games can assist learning and instruction, and perceived higher self-efficacy in their TPACK-G.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this research aimed at determining the TPACK self-efficacy for pre-service science teachers on material development, the relational screening model was used. The research was carried out with a total of 141 pre-service science teachers from Kahramanmaraş S&uuml;tc&uuml; Imam University in 2016-2017 fall academic years. The data were collected by using the &ldquo;Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) self-efficacy scale for pre-service science teachers on material development&rdquo; developed by Bal&ccedil;ın and Erg&uuml;n (2016). Independent-t test, one way variance analysis (ANOVA) and Tukey analysis were used in the statistical evaluation of the obtained data. Also, data are evaluated on 0.05 level relevance and its percentage, frequency, average and standard deviation levels are calculated. According to the findings obtained in the research, it was determined that the variables of grade level and teaching technologies and material development courses were influenced by TPACK self-efficacy for preservice science teachers on material development (p&lt;0.05). However, it was determined that gender, level of academic achievement and intensity of technology use did not affect the TPACK self-efficacy for pre-service science teachers on material development.&rdquo;</p>

Technological understanding. Journal of Technology and Teacher Education, 25(1), 31-59. Abstract retrieved from http://learntechlib.org/p/173346</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Despite the growing popularity of digital teaching portfolios, research has remained focused on outcomes associated with making digital teaching portfolios instead of examining the ways in which they can effectively assess what teachers know, especially when it comes to educational technology. One barrier to using portfolios as a means of assessing teachers&rsquo; knowledge of technology is the lack of a guiding framework for characterizing teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge. In this paper, we propose that the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework is well-suited to study the knowledge (including technological knowledge) teachers represent in their digital teaching portfolios. We exemplify how the TPACK framework can guide a content analysis of digital teaching portfolios by analyzing 589 online portfolios created by teachers as the culminating assessment in their master&rsquo;s studies. We conclude that the TPACK framework is helpful for analyzing the types of technological knowledge teachers may represent in portfolios but also acknowledge several important challenges.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The interactive whiteboard (IWB) is increasingly used for teaching and learning in the classroom. Nevertheless, the ways that teachers incorporate this tool within their teaching practices remain poorly understood. This paper examines elementary and high school teachers&rsquo; self-reported practices with the IWB. The conceptual framework centers on teachers&rsquo; self-reported practices as well as the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, a framework for successful integration of technology into teaching. Data were collected from discussion groups with 30 teachers. Overall, the results show a predominance of technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) and technological knowledge (TK) regardless of grade level, gender, or years of teaching experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The need for providing opportunities for those who seek for advancing his or her knowledge and skills on different subjects while they are away from campus has been a requirement of the era we live in. Thus, the diffusion of distance education concept among educators and use of related technologies in many campuses has been growing. Although different advanced technologies are available for preparing and delivering content online, the important question on how to use these technologies still remains unanswered. Literature on the subject recommends that having access to technology itself does not produce desired outcome, unless it is supported with appropriate pedagogical approaches. This study, therefore, was designed to investigate pedagogy of teaching and learning online from adult students&rsquo; perspectives. Specifically, to understand pedagogical factors that impact student understanding of the content online, how adult students in an online program assess pedagogical approaches represented by course instructors, weaknesses they have experienced and ideas what would be done in terms of pedagogical approach so that adult learners learn better in online environments. Participants stressed on the importance of pedagogical planning and implementation strategies. Among those issues, planning before teaching, social presence through interactions, and feedback mechanism are mostly indicated issues necessary for effective teaching and learning online.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Effective technology integration within all areas of education is an objective in most schools given the amount of time students are using technology personally and at school. PE teachers have been challenged to find innovative ways to integrate technology to enhance student learning. A specific type of knowledge is necessary for integration entitled technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK; Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2008). TPACK provides the theoretical framework for this study and defines the type of knowledge PETE candidates must possess to be prepared to meet the needs of their students and national and state standards. Online instrumentation of a modified version of Pre-Service Teachers&rsquo; Knowledge of Teaching and Technology (Semiz &amp; Ince, 2012) was completed by 91 preservice PETE candidates from several universities in the Northeast. A 5-point Likert-type scaling technique and open-ended responses were used on the 39-item inventory to assess the seven types of knowledge that PETE candidates may possess, along with specific open-ended questions regarding modeling of technology by professors, cooperating teachers, and what the PETE candidates have used thus far.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Information Communications and Technology (ICT) was first introduced through the Smart School project in 1997. Results from past studies on teachers&rsquo; use of ICT were mixed whereby their confidence in using ICT and their use and integration of ICT in their classroom practice were incoherent. Hence, this study intends to investigate the confidence level and skills of current pre-service teachers in teaching the English language through the use of ICT. Forty six pre-service English language teachers were selected purposively from a local university and a teacher training college, based on these few criteria set within the limitations of this study. This atudy adopted and adapted the questionnaires from the ICT Integration Survey (Spazak, 2010) and Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) by Mishra and Koehler (2006). These questionnaires are adopted for the purpose of understanding the pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological skills, as well as their content and pedagogical knowledge of English language teaching at the point in time when the data was collected. The data collected were analysed using the Statistical Packet for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that pre-service English language teachers are confident users of ICT, both for their own personal interests and to integrate ICT in their teaching. However, it is also found that pre-service teachers are skilled in ICT because they have been exposed to it since young. Further results that have emerged from this study revealed that there is no relationship between the time used in ICT and the confidence or skills in using ICT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Establishment of technology assisted environments suitable for new teaching programs has become more of an issue each passing day. From this aspect, Teaching Technologies and Material Design (TTMD) course comes first as applied courses modeling the knowledge generation in pre-service teacher education. One of the teaching activities within the scope of this course is the activities of pre-service teachers for short film preparation and application. Ministry of National Education (MEB) encourages the short film designs through Education Informatics Network (EBA). Integration of technological and pedagogical knowledge that pre-service teachers have within the frame of content knowledge to be taught has been aimed with this kind of activities. This study includes the examination of technological and pedagogical properties of scripts of early childhood pre-service teachers in short film designs. In this research that has been performed with pre-service teachers in KT&Uuml; (Karadeniz Technical University) Fatih Faculty of Education, Early Childhood Education Department, short film production towards the suitable ones for the zones of development and objectives within the MEB Early Childhood Education Program (2013) was asked from groups of four. 5 films selected by criterion sampling method from educational short films prepared, were examined in terms of technical skills, suitability for pedagogical learning objectives and child development, varieties of representation, and knowledge of learner (pre-conceptions and learning disability characteristics). Results refer to that short film contents are suitable for zones of development with pedagogical learning objectives indicators in this type of scripting beside the film preparation skills in terms of technical skills, It has been seen that even if a variety of representation in terms of early childhood education was provided, there are not enough applications characterizing the pre-conceptions in short film contents.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teaching with technology is considered a necessity in the U.S. mathematics classroom. However, few studies have established explicit considerations to support technology-enhanced student achievement. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effectiveness of technology in the mathematics classroom by systematically reviewing meta-analytic research. An exhaustive literature search was conducted. After applying a priori inclusion criteria the pool of 65 initial meta-analyses was reduce to 13 representative studies. Each study was reviewed and characteristics were coded in four categories: (1) sample, (2) measurement, (3) design, and (4) source. An inductive review of the coded studies produced five unique moderators that were the most salient across studies. Overall mean effect sizes were retrieved or calculated from available study data. Hedges g was used as the common effect size metric for comparison across studies. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework was used to interpret the most salient moderators of effects across studies. Studies were categorized by didactical functionality and technology type. The results suggest that effects vary by didactical functionality from small to medium. The largest variations were observed for the didactical function of developing conceptual understanding. Implications for research and instructional praxis are provided.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper aims to explore practicing teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the approach adopted in their pre-service training programs with regard to educational technology. The paper also investigates the extent to which the teachers employ technology to accomplish pedagogical goals as well as the instructional methodology they embrace when they use ICT in the classroom. The thrust of the argument in the current study is that the way practicing teachers use educational technology is reflective of the inadequacy of the pre-service training programs that still insist on disentangling ICT from pedagogy and content. Informed by TPACK, a four-section, five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to 56 ELT practitioners in middle and secondary education in the province of El-Jadida. It was found that the integration of technology, pedagogy and content was left to the discretion of the teachers. This approach resulted in limited ICT implementation for instructional purposes and inconsistent interpretations of how ICT can best be used in the classroom. Although the teachers reported that they embraced a student-centered methodology while using ICT, they also fell back on teacher-centered instructional principles. On the basis of the results obtained, a number of implications will be offered for an effective ICT-oriented ELT teacher education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This chapter investigates challenges faced by educators in the early elementary grades as well as opportunities to transform science education in these critical, early years of schooling. We studied kindergarten teacher&rsquo;s first attempt to integrate one-to-one technology in an inquiry-based science lesson, drawing on works of Randi Engle to analyze the framing of the students and the activity, as well as on the works of Peggy Ertmer and colleagues to investigate barriers encountered in the implementation process. We employed Mishra and Koehler&rsquo;s (2006) Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework to understand the dynamic triad of teacher&rsquo;s pedagogy, content, and technology knowledge, need for successful technology implementation endeavors. While implementations of technology enhanced inquiry-based science lessons in early elementary grades present educators with some unique dilemmas, they also carry a potential for sparking the scientific curiosity of the youngest elementary school learners&rsquo; and illuminating the years to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The sheer volume of technological innovations with educational potential along with the myriad of instructional theories and models present quite the challenge for educators. A contemporary framework is needed to connect these components with learning theory and to ultimately serve as a guide to educators grappling with how to align the interrelated components of effective instruction when using educational technologies. The objective of this chapter is to present a viable contemporary framework to fulfill this need. The Adaptable Learning Theory Framework for Technology Enhanced Learning (AF-TEL) provides a framework based on the cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence tenets of the Community of Inquiry model (Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2003) to achieve desired educational outcomes. Professional Development for STEM Teachers using Discovery Labs (PDSTDL) is a format of teacher professional development that integrates AF-TEL to address the critical need of preparing effective STEM teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;To make a connection between pedagogy and technology in teaching, this chapter will explore whether or not a professional development design and practice, whose aim is to help teachers use technology for personal purposes, readily translates into the ability to effectively teach and learn with technology. Adopting a conceptual framework known as self-efficacy beliefs and TPACK, or technological pedagogical content knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), this chapter discusses the design of a professional development model, the goal of which is increasing the critical attribute of the successful professional development: self-efficacy. In an effort to provide empirical knowledge to support this design, this chapter further showcases a faculty member&rsquo;s approaches to connecting technology and pedagogy using the TPACK approach, while implementing a model designed to improve teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy. Implications and guidelines for developing teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy, through activities during the professional development workshop, are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teacher educators have a responsibility to help prospective teachers in their professional growth. It is important that teacher educators not only teach prospective teachers about benefits of active learning in student learning, but that they also prepare future teachers in using pedagogical methods aligned with active learning principles. This manuscript provides examples of how mathematics teacher educators can promote prospective teachers&rsquo; active learning and professional growth by bringing together the Flipped Classroom method with video content on teaching and learning as well as workplace learning opportunities in a pedagogy course. The professional learning of prospective teachers is framed according to the components of the Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Park &amp; Olive, 2008; Shulman, 1986). Implications for future trends in teacher education are provided.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this research was to explore what is delaying the full adoption of technology as an instructional tool in education. Phase I of this mixed-methods study employed the use of a survey with upper elementary school teachers in a large urban school district in South Florida to establish an understanding of strategies elementary school teachers apply in overcoming intrinsic and extrinsic barriers while exploring their beliefs, attitudes and concerns about adopting technology for instructional purposes. Using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) theoretical framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), this study explored the types of barriers most obstructive in teachers&rsquo; efforts to implement technology and identified strategies applied by teachers effectively using technology. Survey participants self-identified as high or low users of technology and analyses revealed a significant difference in their attitudes, values and beliefs and their use of strategies in overcoming barriers in technology use. No significant difference was found in the extrinsic barriers to technology use which must be addressed. Phase II of the study included three focus groups from the same sample group, exploring the phenomena of adopting technology. The themes emerged focused on the need for professional development, the need for increased technical and administrative support and the need for more updated equipment (software and hardware). This research effectively captured the concerns and opinions of both high and low technology users and provided insight into how educational institutions might better prepare educators to more efficiently align instruction with the use of technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The researcher explored the effect of post-professional development on the use of iPads in the classroom at a diverse, private catholic high school. Using a mixed method study design, the researcher surveyed colleagues about their iPad use in the classroom, their experience with iPad integration and professional development training effectiveness. The researcher examined how students and teachers were using technology in the classroom and how professional development could assist educators in the integration of educational technology into the classroom. Educational technology was found to be linked to student achievement, in turn improving student retention of learned materials. Teachers were found to understand the importance and necessity of technology in the classroom, yet some digital immigrant teachers were resistant to full integration of technology for a number of reasons. The study revealed that professional development could improve the integration of technology, but ongoing support for the integration of technology into the classroom is lacking. The researcher found that the faculty and students would benefit from the introduction of an educational technology library, along with an Educational Technologist who could assist teachers in bridging the digital divide between themselves and their digital native students.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;One-to-one electronic devices have become commonplace in many educational settings across the globe, but it has been unclear how long-term teaching practices using such devices have evolved and how they relate to recognized best practices for using technology in the classroom. This study examined what a generation of teachers has over time identified as best applications of using these devices; their benefits, drawbacks, and challenges; and whether their use reflected previously identified best application of technologies in the classroom. This case study, conducted in one school system in New England, used the theories of Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) and Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Analysis (TPACK) as a conceptual framework. Participants included two groups, one composed of four teachers who have taught only after implementation of one-on-one laptop use and one composed of four teachers who taught both before and after device implementation, selected to determine whether differences existed in attitudes and practices based on types of teaching experience. Data sources included interviews and observations. Results indicated both veteran and established teachers embraced the use of one-to-one devices in their teaching, but both groups lacked the knowledge of SAMR and TPACK theories to best apply them in the classroom. This study contributes to the field by including recommendations for h5er teacher technology implementation, including more in-depth training and support with application of TPACK and SAMR theories in classroom pedagogy.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multi-case study examines the relationships between preservice teachers&rsquo; beliefs and knowledge regarding teaching mathematics with technology. Based on the theoretical framework on teacher beliefs and Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (TPACK), I investigated four preservice secondary mathematics teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) and their beliefs about the nature of mathematics, learning and teaching mathematics, and the use of technology in the mathematics classroom. Three semi-structured interviews (beliefs, task-based, and performance interviews) were used to collect data about the preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK components, beliefs, and how to use a technology tool in their imaginary mathematics teaching. The findings of this study indicated that preservice teachers with sophisticated or student-centered beliefs about the nature of mathematics, learning mathematics, and technology use displayed higher levels of mathematical content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and technological content knowledge, respectively, than preservice teachers with traditional or teacher-centered beliefs about mathematics, learning mathematics, and technology use. In addition, this study suggested that in order to effectively use technology to teach mathematics, preservice teachers should develop their beliefs and knowledge in all areas of mathematics, pedagogy, and technology. Understanding the relationships between preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK and beliefs provides insights into how teacher education programs can support preservice teachers to develop TPACK and integrate technology into their future mathematics instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in teaching and learning is of significant importance to a country&rsquo;s development and the social growth of individuals. As a result, ICT usage is gaining momentum in world schooling systems. Cognisant of the benefits of ICTs in teaching and learning, South African schools have introduced ICTs in schools and teachers are compelled to adopt and integrate technology to improve their pedagogic activities. The purpose of this research was to explore South African teachers&rsquo; experience in using ICT in the schooling system. This study was underpinned by the Network Society theoretical framework that endorses the use of ICTs in teaching and learning environments. The research method used in the study followed a qualitative interpretative approach and data collection methods included a literature study, non-participant observation and semi-structured interviews with a purposefully selected sample of teachers and school principals and analysis of documents on ICTs in teaching and learning. Findings indicated that ICT integration in teaching and learning is endorsed by teachers and principals who understand the benefits of ICT in enabling better methodological strategies, greater collaboration among teachers, improved access to the required information and the ability to cater for learners with different potential and learning styles. However, a number of factors that hinder the successful ICT integration in urban schools were identified as inadequate ICT infrastructure, teachers&rsquo; lack of ICT skills and low level of ICT proficiency, inadequate training, negative attitudes and poor teacher confidence. Other factors included lack of ICT leadership, funds and technical support. These findings indicated poor implementation of policy and a lack of connection between theory and practice. It was concluded that all education stakeholders, including parents, should work together in securing an ICT infrastructure that will accommodate all learners. It was recommended that more regular workshops which focus on the development of ICT skills in accordance with the proficiency levels required to effect successful integration of ICTs by teachers, be conducted. Moreover, principals should attend training workshops to learn about their responsibilities as ICT leaders at school. Technological pedagogical and content knowledge (PACK) together with CRAR3FS2 principles could provide a crucial framework for training South African teachers to overcome their ICT skill challenges. The ultimate goal of this study is to analyse factors that both hinder and enable the integration of ICTs into teaching practice in South Africa and to contribute to the body of literature on ICT integration in South African urban schools.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examined how preservice English Language Arts teachers learn to teach and use their knowledge of content, pedagogy, and technology during an English education course focused on technology. Seeking to address a gap in the research, this study utilized a case study methodology to look at preservice teachers&rsquo; learning about the flipped classroom and designing lessons integrating technology as a way for a teacher education course to facilitate preservice teachers&rsquo; construction of their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. The participants were preservice English teachers taking an online English education course during Summer 2015. The researcher used a survey to purposefully select nine individuals with a range of self-reported knowledge. Participants were then interviewed twice, had their course assignments collected and analyzed, and submitted three written reflections. The course that the participants took challenged preservice teachers to bring together their content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge to create flipped lessons videos and a series of lesson plans. The data showed that there was no pattern or stages of TPACK development. Participants saw potential for flipped learning to be useful in secondary English classes and that while participants wanted to use technology and teach digital literacies in their future classrooms, they also wanted their students to engage in traditional print literacy.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK, an extension of Pedagogical Content Knowledge, has the potential to provide a theoretical lens through which researchers can focus on the skills teachers need to meaningfully incorporate technology into instruction. To date, however, TPACK has been a challenge to measure because of imprecise definitions and confounded dimensions.</p>
<p>This study utilized Rasch modeling to assess an existing TPACK instrument, perceived TPACK knowledge of online teachers, and the TPACK theoretical framework itself. An analysis from a nationwide sample of 165 online teachers indicated that the instrument is producing valid and reliable measures. Participants rated their own knowledge highest in areas related to Content and Pedagogy, and lowest in the area of Technology. Significant differences were found across genders, ages, and years of service.</p>
<p>Data analysis also revealed that several of the component areas of TPACK were conflated by participants. Ultimately, this study could not validate the seven component theoretical structure of TPACK, and offers an alternate framework based on the Rasch analysis. Several topics for future research were also recommended.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Underprepared college students take zero credit courses, extending their stay, and increase college debt which may lead to attrition (SUNY, 2015). President Obama&rsquo;s Affordability Proposal reported on a college &ldquo;cost crisis&rdquo; created &ldquo;by failing to use technology to its fullest effect&rdquo; (Kelly and Carey, 2013). The non-profit Alliance for Excellence in Education, in 2006, reported that community colleges alone spent $1.4 billion per year on remedial courses for recent high school graduates (Smydo, 2008). This quantitative study reports on the perceptions of NYS community college math faculty on the effectiveness of a math MOOC as a remediation strategy, use in remedial courses and as free online educational resource for the math college placement exam. After levels of Technology Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK), faculty MOOC Awareness (MA) and perceived Barriers to Technology Integration (BTI) were measured, faculty reviewed a sample math MOOC syllabus with a delivery system containing instructional videos, self-assessments and a dashboard of student math competencies and reported on Math MOOC Remediation Effectiveness (MMRE) and Faculty Interest in teaching with MOOC Remediation (FIMR). Faculty expressed their willingness to collaborate in MOOC creation. The electronic survey was juried and factor analyzed for content and construct validity. Results showed that community college math faculty had low familiarity with MOOCs as a remediation strategy. However after viewing a video intervention showing a free sample MOOC with tutorials, platform faculty perceived that Math MOOC Remediation may be an effective educational strategy to increase passing rates on math competency entrance tests and to increase passing rates in college remedial math courses. Significant differences were found within this study. Significant positional differences indicated that adjunct math faculty had greater interest in teaching a future math remedial course if a remedial math MOOC was aligned to the college syllabus. Full-time math faculty was more aware of MOOCs as an educational strategy. This study found an inverse significant correlation which indicated that that older faculty with greater years of college teaching tended to have less interest in teaching with MOOC Remediation. Significant gender differences were found indicating that males teach more online courses than females.</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The ministry of education is launching an overall project to implement the use of ICT in the Israeli education system. To prepare pre-service teachers with whom we work for this kind of implementation, we designed a model, which prepares them to use digital tools effectively while integrating particular pedagogy for teaching a specific mathematics or science content. The goal of the present research is to study the development of these pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK (technological, pedagogical and content knowledge), attitudes toward computers and their ICT proficiency. For this purpose, we used questionnaires developed by the MOFET institute and by previous studies. The research results show significant improvement in the TPACK level and ICT proficiency, but no significant effect of the preparation on most of the components of the teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward computers, being positively high before and after the preparation.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study aims to explore the use of technology in the classroom for teaching purposes in a university environment. The research provides evidence both on the use of the technological tool and the instructive task performed with it. Based on a survey of 112 professors, the tools were classified into items of mobile and social media (SM), learning management systems (LMS) and graphic and dynamic visualizations (Graphic). Regarding the Faculty, the study collected a number of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, discipline, academic background and experience in online teaching. Results show the limited use of technology in classroom, highlighting only those technologies related with graphic and dynamic presentations, while they do show correlation between the use of LMS tools and SM tools. However, significant differences in the use of technology in the classroom have been found between teachers from different disciplines, academic backgrounds and prior experience with online teaching, while no differences were detected in other variables. This investigation thus contributes to studies that aim to advance the effective integration of technology in teaching and learning by introducing relevant teacher variables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology, education and design are at the heart of any educational transaction. For optimum impact these need to be carefully choreographed and orchestrated. Despite acknowledgement and acceptance of technology, education and design as critical attributes of any successful educational transaction, bringing them together to ensure transformational change, both at the individual and at the institutional level, remains a serious challenge. This includes not only the development of the knowledge and understanding of the subject matter content, but also a rethink and reorientation of the essential value principles of education. This paper reports a case study of the experiences of the Open University of Sri Lanka in bringing about such transformational change in relation to the adoption of open educational practices (OEP) over the past decade. This is captured in the narratives of key participants involved in the projects. These achievements comprise: 1) the professional development of academic staff in the integration of OER; 2) a robust model for the integration of OER; and 3) a rigorous approach to the evaluation of the impacts of OER integration on a range of dependent variables including perceptions and practices of educators towards OEP.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this exploratory single-case study was to investigate the affordances of iPads and how these affordances transpired within a technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework by four early childhood educators at a low-income family preschool in Honolulu, Hawaii. Early childhood education (ECE) will be defined as education from birth to age eight although this study focused primarily on educators for preschool age group that is from age three to five. The targeted participants included four preschool teachers with varying technological skills and knowledge. Methods of data collection were pre-survey, post-survey, follow-up survey, group interviews, follow-up interviews, classroom observations, and documentation of iPad workshops and other email correspondences. The data included existing data from a grant project completed at the end of 2013 and new data from follow-up interviews collected in May 2014. The data were analyzed using coding methods in two cycles. The three major findings were 1) the exploration of affordances provided by iPads showed common themes of efficiency and effectiveness in assessing, teaching, and learning. In addition, there were some affordances particular to teaching and learning; 2) the exploration in how participating teachers discovered the affordances of iPad over time indicated parallel progression in technological knowledge and change in their value system about the affordances of iPad; and 3) the exploration in the progression of technological knowledge and change in their value system about the affordances of iPad within the TPACK framework suggested that there was a close relationship between progression of technological knowledge (TK) towards TPACK and progression of affective-valuing (AV) towards affective-characterization by value system (AC).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The expansion of Internet and Wi-Fi nowadays facilitated the use of cloud-based content creation such as Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), which had changed the current educational paradigm and ways of interaction between teachers and students. This paper attempts to shed light on the Special Education (hearing impairment) teachers&rsquo; beliefs towards the educational potential and the integration of Frog VLE in T&amp;L process. It also examined teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) to teach in a virtual learning environments. The sample consisted of 40 secondary teachers drawn randomly from special education school in Penang. Overall, findings indicated that teachers believed the educational potential and expected value of Frog VLE in educational practices. Yet, teachers seems not confidence and uncertainty regarding their knowledge about pedagogical use of learning activities in practice. The results of TPACK towards Frog VLE integration showed that there is still some room for improvements, particularly technology related components. Furthermore, the Pearson Correlation analyses indicated that there were positively significant relationship between teachers&rsquo; beliefs towards the educational potential and the integration of Frog VLE with their technological knowledge. It was concluded that in the realm of Frog VLE in the hearing impairment classroom, teachers&rsquo; belief and knowledge of Frog VLE integration is important in order to establish a best learning environment for the hearing impairment students. Implications and recommendations are made in focusing professional development efforts to reinforce special education (hearing impairment) teachers&rsquo; beliefs and facilitate their TPACK towards Frog VLE integration.

<p>Excerpt: &ldquo;About 5 years ago, the college eliminated its stand-alone educational technology course and instead began infusing the tech content into methods courses. Because of the college&rsquo;s large size, this undertaking required massive support and commitment among dozens of faculty and administrators&hellip; Over time, the college&rsquo;s initiative has surmounted the challenges of large-scale implementation and won over students and faculty alike. Guided by the principles of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and focused on developing both candidates&rsquo; and their instructors&rsquo; technology-integration skills, the initiative reached 75 sections of 18 methods courses last semester, taught by 59 instructors to over 2,000 students.&rdquo;</p>

This work is grounded in considerations of the technological, pedagogical and content (TPACK) requirements of teachers.<br />Research on the TPACK concept argues that teachers integrate digital technologies most effectively when they consider the ways in which different platforms allow them to represent content in different ways. This means they can engage their students in more comprehensive learning activities.<br />My work at the Royal Botanic Gardens has been designed to use AR technology with a particular pedagogical approach (constructivism) and to represent particular content (environmental sustainability and Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander histories and cultures) to students in ways that would be otherwise difficult to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates pre-service teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) levels based on different variables. A total of 609 final year student teachers who are trained in five different subject areas (elementary teaching, social science teaching, science teaching, mathematics, and Turkish Teaching) of an education faculty participated in the study. The study was carried out in the spring semester of the 2014-2015 academic year. An adapted Turkish version of the TPACK Scale was used as the data collection instrument. The data was analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software. An independent t-test, ANOVA, Mann Whitney-U, and Kruskal Wallis Tests for non-parametric data were used for statistical analysis. The results show, in the current state, participants have good levels of TPACK. It is also found that there are meaningful relationships and significant differences between some variables such as gender, program attended, having a personal computer and Internet connection, and sub-factors of the TPACK scale. It is suggested that more practical opportunities should be facilitated for pre-service teachers at education faculties to prepare them for 21st century schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study provides insight into preservice teachers&rsquo; experiences with integrating technology into lessons with children who had mild learning disabilities. Participants included 14 junior early childhood education majors enrolled in a special education course with a fieldwork component. The researchers collected and analyzed lesson plans, journal entries, focus group interviews, and field notes. The findings illustrated preservice teachers&rsquo; use of iPad apps during fieldwork, identified their technology-related instructional decisions, and determined how those choices exhibited emerging dimensions of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). The preservice teachers combined their knowledge of pedagogy, student understanding of content, and emerging knowledge of iPad apps to effectively develop and conduct lessons in various content areas. Interviews with the students supported the social validity of the iPad implementation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to attain an insight into pre-service science teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) as an integrative competency that is addressed by 21st century skills. The methods used in the study was descriptive. Nineteen pre-service science teachers (PSTs) of an educational university in Indonesia were involved in a semester long school science course. The course mainly develop students&rsquo; pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by utilizing content representation (CoRe) template. Furthermore an infusion of technological knowledge (TK) analysis led to the study of their TPACK by extending the template with a question in line to TK. The extended CoRe and self-reported survey were employed as instruments. The analysis of data used were quantitative and qualitative technique to obtain the insight into PSTs&rsquo; PCK and TK. The results shows contrary value of PCK and TK identified by CoRe template to those measured by self-reported survey. However, the PSTs perceive their TPACK much higher, that, is 74.74%. Further investigation regarding PSTs ability to compose lesson plan was recommended for further research to capture more comprehensive insight into PSTs&rsquo; TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract:<br />&ldquo;Aim/Purpose The aim of the study is to examine what ICT coordinators perceive as the main elements of knowledge needed to implement ICT successfully into school culture.<br />Background For the past few years, Israel&rsquo;s Ministry of Education has been running a national program of adapting the education system to the 21st century skills. Key teachers have been appointed as ICT coordinators. Their role was to implement technology in schools. Methodology The participants in this study were 130 ICT coordinators in Israeli Hebrew and Arabic schools. Those ICT coordinators had to attend a special in-service 60- hour course throughout an entire school year. The research tool was the reflection of the ICT coordinators who were asked to complete at the end of the inservice course. Narrative analysis was chosen as the main approach to data analysis.<br />Contribution We claim that ICT coordinators maintain a complex perception of their role, based on broad personal and professional knowledge that enables them to lead the needed changes. Findings Based on the findings the coordinators revealed primary successful elements of their work: (a) technological aspects, (b) pedagogical aspects, (c) the organizational aspects, and (d) the ICT coordinator as a leader of systemic change. The first two elements already appear in the TPACK construct, while the others constitute organizational knowledge (OK) and leadership knowledge (LK) that enables the coordinators to facilitate ICT implementation in schools, and these are the unique elements of this study.<br />Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend that when choosing ICT coordinators or ICT implementation leaders at school, one should check not only that they possess the familiar TPACK knowledge, but also organizational knowledge and leadership knowledge that was found essential to successful completion of the coordinators&rsquo; role.<br />Impact on Society This study has shed light on the nature and significance of leadership knowledge (LK) and its function as an additional expression of TPACK.<br />Future Research We suggest that future research about educational technology leaders&rsquo; TPACK be drawn from these results.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The current study investigates the attitudes of teachers towards Computer-Assisted Education (CAE) and their knowledge of technology, pedagogy and content via TPACK model that assesses the competencies for developing and implementing successful teaching. There were 280 participants in the study. The results of the study indicate that teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards CAE scores are much higher than their TPACK scores. There is a low level positive correlation between their TPACK competencies and their attitudes towards CAE. Particularly, teachers&rsquo; competencies of Technology Knowledge (TK) and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK) have much higher relationship with their attitude towards CAE when compared to other competencies. Attitude toward CAE is observed to differ by gender. As for TPACK competencies, TK and Technological Content Knowledge (TCK) differ by gender. The TPACK framework explains 20% of attitudes towards CAE. TK is the construct having the highest effect in explaining the attitude towards using CAE.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this paper, we discuss how a university lecturer (pseudonym: James) drew on his technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) when planning to integrate technology in teaching. The main purpose of the study was to use real-life planning observations to understand James&rsquo;s TPACK. The data were obtained through think-aloud sessions in which James planned a course that is offered to undergraduate initial teacher education (ITE) students in a research-intensive Australian university. Chi&rsquo;s (1997) verbal analysis method was used to analyse verbal qualitative data. The results indicate that a different set of knowledge domains underpinned James&rsquo;s decisions in each different episode of his planning sessions giving his TPACK a dynamic and context-sensitive nature. We suggest observations of teachers when making actual planning decisions as one of the preferred methods to understand the nature of their TPACK. The study introduces a new approach in understanding how this teacher&rsquo;s TPACK looks when he drew on various domains of knowledge, by visually presenting the combinations made among knowledge domains.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In the current study, the model of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) is used as the theoretical framework in the process of data collection and interpretation of the results. This study analyzes the perceptions of 744 undergraduate students regarding their TPACK levels measured by responses to a survey developed by Sahin (2011). The survey contains seven subscales: Technology knowledge (TK), pedagogy knowledge (PK), content knowledge (CK), technological pedagogy knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK). These seven subscales form the seven variables of the study. The findings show that teacher candidates with more technology knowledge will have more knowledge in pedagogy and content. Also, pedagogy seems as the only variable that is significantly related to all of the variables presented in the TPACK model. This result suggests that pedagogy is the core knowledge of the TPACK. In the study, technology and content knowledge domains influence the TPACK indirectly. Moreover, only the dyadic knowledge components including the content knowledge are related the TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This mixed-methods study explored the impacts of a semester-long technology professional development for secondary school international teachers from developing nations around the world. We used (a) a survey approach to examine international teachers&rsquo; perceived technology integration abilities using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework and (b) a design task to understand their rationale behind technology integration decisions. As a group (N = 16), international teachers reported increased abilities in all TPACK domains. Qualitative analysis of their rationales revealed that though teachers learned to consider the affordances of technology, technology access issues were pivotal in their choice and use of technology in instruction planning. With education becoming increasingly global, the study has implications for the motivation and design of technology professional development programs for international teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teachers&rsquo; beliefs, together with sound technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), are directly related to the effective integration of technology in mathematics teaching. This study explored the relationship between pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention to use technology to teach mathematics and their TPACK. A case-study analysis was conducted to determine whether six pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention to use technology in their classroom delivery was associated with a predominance of TPACK (the TPACK model component) in their choice of technology-supported mathematical tasks. The findings showed a considerable disconnect between pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention and their technological pedagogical content knowledge. Even where they expressed favourable intentions, the type of knowledge they called into play when selecting technology-supported tasks was unrelated to TPACK and did not suffice to identify the educational potential of technology. An emphasis on TPACK, in conjunction with the development of favourable attitudes toward the use of technology, is therefore believed to be indispensable in pre-service teacher education programmes.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this study, a survey was carried out on the use of Technology Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) in teaching and learning practices to enhance the quality of engineering students. TEAL is one of the new learning formats that involve the use of simulations, hands-on experiments and lectures in the curriculum or learning process; a variety of technologies are applied to achieve learning goals. The application of TEAL encompasses five elements, namely: online learning, hands-on experiment, blended learning, collaborative learning and lab activities. This study implemented TEAL in practicing teaching and learning technology, pedagogy and content (TPACK) to enhance the quality and employability of engineering students through the improved curriculum of education. With the help of technologies in the learning process, students are poised to meet the need of the industry as professionals and excellent workers upon their graduation. For this purpose, final year students in the course of Bachelor of Engineering at Technical University Network (MTUN), a leading technical university network specialising in technological skills, were involved in this study. In this survey of TEAL, quantitative research methods were used to collect the relevant data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This article explicates the conception and evaluation of an information and communications technologies (ICT) professional development process for developing teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge for 21st century learning. The process emphasizes teachers&rsquo; prolonged engagement with peers and researchers in design teams. Supported by technological pedagogical content knowledge rubrics and technological pedagogical content knowledge design heuristics, the process enabled teachers to assess their current ICT lessons, set design goals, redesign, implement, and evaluate student learning outcomes, as well as reflect on their pedagogical practices. A year-long implementation study conducted with 37 teachers from a Singapore primary school who were organized into seven lesson design teams found that the process had positive effects on teachers&rsquo; confidence for technological pedagogical content knowledge for 21st century learning and lesson design practices. Five of the seven design teams were able to make pedagogical changes toward 21st century learning, and six of the teams realized improvement in student learning outcomes. The implications for teacher ICT professional development are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The goal of this study is to analyze the situations of teachers&rsquo; technology acceptance and usage (TAU) and web pedagogy content knowledge (WPACK) in terms of different variations and to determine of the relationship between these two. The study group of this research consists of 96 teachers in total having different variations such as different branches, different professional seniorities, different ages and different educational levels they work in. Data collection tools comprising of 3 open-ended questions which are developed and structured by researchers and two different scales measuring technology acceptance and usage and web pedagogical content knowledge are utilized in this study. The scales and structured forms are applied through random sampling with screening model. In the results of the research, teachers&rsquo; technology acceptance and usage situations, web pedagogical content knowledge situations and their sexes and web 2.0 technologies usage situations don&rsquo;t differ in terms of the dimensions and the entirety of the scales. The following are established according to the results; there are differences among teachers&rsquo; TAU situations, there aren&rsquo;t any differences among their WPACK in terms of their branches; there aren&rsquo;t any differences among their TAU situations and there are differences among their WPACK situations in terms of their ages; TAU and WPACK situations are not reasonable statistically in terms of their professional seniorities and educational levels they work in. Furthermore, it is also determined that web applications usage durations are not reasonable in terms of their TAU situations but they are reasonable in terms of WPACK. The answers which teachers provided towards open-ended questions are established to be categorized as education, technology, interaction, visuality, source and development. Additionally, it is settled that there is a low correlation between TAU and WPACK situations but it is possible to form a model between them. From the point of view of the findings of this study, it is suggested that knowledge and information regarding technology integration is provided experimentally to teachers in in-service seminars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The 21st century English teachers and lecturers are required to have competencies in translating Content Knowledge (CK), integrating various Pedagogical Knowledge (PK) and implementing Technological Knowledge (TK) in order to produce effective and efficient teaching. This research reveals and describes researcher&rsquo;s efforts and pre-service EFL teachers&rsquo; (Pre-service EFL teachers) roles in designing and developing the supplemental teaching and learning materials with PowerPoint, Audacity, Camtasia and Internet (PACI) model. To transform researcher roles and model to introduce and implement Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, this research implemented blended learning: traditional face to face and Facebook closed-group discussion based on Project-Based Learning. This research employed the qualitative autobiography narrative of self-study from the researcher&rsquo;s experiences to implement blended learning. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four Pre-service EFL teachers of group A and five Pre-service EFL teachers of group B to seek the Pre-service EFL teachers&rsquo; experiences in designing and developing PACI model. The results suggested that blended learning could effectively and efficiently integrate and implement the design and development of a PACI model. Most importantly both researcher and two groups realized that in integration of TPACK during a Computer Literacy course, the subject matter may be shaped by the application of technology; teaching as well as learning might be changed by the use of technology and the way to represent and communicate specific lessons to students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper presents three cases of technology intervention in classrooms where the TPACK model seemingly falls short of a due consideration of context. The argument is made that context can drive pedagogy, technology and content independently whilst the established interactions of each continues to occur. The analysis suggests that contextual factors of culture, learning challenges and second language study present additional complexity to the teaching and learning environment especially as technology is employed to empower learning.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology applications can make important contributions to improving learning outcomes in the domain of early literacy. However, to fully exploit the potential of educational technologies, teachers must have specific knowledge and skills. This study aimed to articulate the technological pedagogical content knowledge teachers need to make effective use of technology for early literacy. Through three rounds of expert consultation using a Delphi study approach, key priorities for the education of lower primary school teachers, especially those teaching kindergarten, were articulated. The results of the Delphi study show expert consensus on the importance of educating pre-service teachers about: electronic books and educative television; explicit goals and task-focused instructions using specific tools; how to shape technology-rich classroom interactions; and how to integrate computer activities in language teaching. Experts stress the importance of developing age-appropriate teaching skills and critical consideration of the value of technologies for specific learning goals. When this critical stance is lacking (e.g., using technology for entertainment, or substitution of existing activities), they recommend against technology use in kindergarten. These findings can help teacher education programs offer pre-service teachers adequate opportunities to develop the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge needed for effectively using technology in the domain of early literacy.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Despite the rapid proliferation of information and communication technologies, there exists a paucity of empirical research on the causes of the current low acceptance of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) by English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC). This study aims to remedy this situation through the identification of factors influencing preservice EFL teachers&rsquo; intention to adopt Web 2.0 technologies for language learning purposes in the PRC. Based on the technology acceptance model and the technological pedagogical content knowledge model, a hypothesized seven-factor model was tested via structural equation modeling with data obtained from 295 preservice EFL teachers in the PRC. The results revealed that intention to use CALL 2.0 was predicted most h5ly by facilitating conditions. This finding can help stakeholders to make informed decisions about various aspects of facilitating conditions to effectively enhance preservice EFL teachers&rsquo; acceptance of CALL 2.0 in the PRC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology drives our society and plays a crucial role in classrooms today. Technology is being purchased and put into classrooms at an alarming rate. While the impact on learning has not reached its potential; educators need to explore how we go about integrating technology so that it positively impacts educational processes and learning outcomes. This research study explored both teacher and administrator perceptions of technology integration and professional development with the intent of finding ways administrators can support teachers with integrating technology in the classroom in order to impact learning. Teachers and administrators in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston were surveyed and their responses were used to develop a second survey. This survey was given to a focus group of teachers at Christ the Redeemer Catholic School in Houston, Texas. The study revealed differences between: how administrators and teachers define technology integration; ways in which teachers want to learn about technology integration; ways in which administrators plan on presenting that information; and between what teachers want to learn about technology integration and what administrators are teaching during technology-related professional development.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a conceptual framework for teachers to teach effectively using technology. This framework originates from the opinion that use of technology in educational context would be effective only if content, pedagogy and technology are aligned carefully. It implies that for teachers to use technology in their teaching, they need to be competent in all three domains. This present paper is an attempt to understand the assumptions and components of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as a conceptual framework. Further, the paper addresses the issues and challenges in preparing teachers with TPACK capabilities, apart from emphasizing the role of teacher educators, pre-service, and in-service teachers in understanding TPACK for effective classroom teaching and learning. Suggestions for developing TPACK competencies among teacher educators, inservice teachers, and preservice teachers were discussed. Recommendation for restructuring curriculum of teacher training programmes was also included.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper review 10 papers that relating to gamification adoption in developing technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. Technological developments lately led to the trend of increased use of ICT in the learning process, one of which is gamification. Gamification is the concept of applying game mechanics and game design techniques to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals. Gamification in education as an intersection of learning and fun. The problem is that not all game&rsquo;s attributes suitable for use in presents a teaching material. TPACK is a framework for the teacher that described a complex interaction among three bodies of knowledge: content, pedagogy and technology. TPACK engagement has an impact on the teacher mastery in dimension of teaching material content, in addition to improve teachers skill in developing technology in classroom learning.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this paper, we explore the process of becoming a teacher educator in the pedagogical use of digital tools in mathematics teaching. The study took place in the context of an in-service program during the trainees&rsquo; engagement in their practicum fieldwork activities including the process observation&ndash;reflection&ndash;design&ndash;implementation&ndash;reflection. We explored the features of this context that facilitated the trainees&rsquo; transition from the level of trainee educator to the level of teacher educator as well as the nature of the trainees&rsquo; documentation work for teachers. The results showed that observation of other teacher educators&rsquo; teaching in conjunction with reflection during the program&rsquo;s respective sessions facilitated the trainees&rsquo; transition to the professional level. The identified operational invariants underlying the trainees&rsquo; designs concerned the focus of their observation in teacher education classrooms, the importance they attributed to the constraints and opportunities provided by the wider educational context and epistemological issues regarding the teaching and learning of mathematics with technology. The analysis of trainees&rsquo; designs revealed three kinds of documents (&lsquo;explanatory,&rsquo; &lsquo;instructive&rsquo; and &ldquo;facilitative&rdquo;) and corresponding roles of trainees during the implementation. These documents targeted different aspects of TPACK depending on the trainees&rsquo; conceptualizations of teachers&rsquo; roles either &lsquo;as students&rsquo; or &lsquo;of students.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework &ndash; a framework which proposes a set of knowledge domains that are essential for effective teaching with technology &ndash; has gained considerable attention in the domain of education and technology. With the efforts to conceptualize these knowledge domains comes the question to what extent they can be distinguished empirically. Hence, the present study examines a measure that assesses pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy in the technology-related TPACK dimensions (&ldquo;T-dimensions&rdquo;). In pursuit of crafting a validity argument, we investigated its factor structure and tested it for measurement invariance across gender and educational tracks, two subgroups that may indicate considerable differences. By means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, the data of N = 665 pre-service teachers in 18 teacher training institutions in Flanders (Belgium) revealed a nested factor structure of the TPACK measure, which comprised a general factor and a specific factor of pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological knowledge. This factor structure was fully invariant across gender and educational tracks. Mean differences between educational tracks did not occur; yet, substantial differences were found across gender in favor of male pre-service teachers. This study sheds light on critical aspects of crafting a validity argument for the measurement of the T-dimensions in the TPACK framework and reports relevant subgroup differences.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;With information technology being employed extensively in school education, the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) theoretical framework is adopted by a growing number of researchers to study, assess and advance teachers&rsquo; ability to integrate IT into course teaching. However, there is no measurement instrument designed specifically to assess Geography teachers&rsquo; TPACK competences in Mainland China so far. In this study, based on the currently available TPACK measurement instruments, we attempt to develop, following the 7- factor TPACK model, a measurement scale for senior high school Geography teachers in Mainland China. Invitation emails were sent to target teachers and a total of 869 valid responses were received from 9 Mainland provinces. Confirmatory factor analysis was administered on the collected data to attest convergent validity and discriminant validity of the scale, as well as the 7-factor TPACK model. As demonstrated with our research findings, the TPACK knowledge structure of senior high school Geography teachers in Mainland China accords with the 7-factor model, with factor loadings of the 37 measured variables all distributed between 0.57 and 0.94, and composite validity values of each factor ranging between 0.87 and 0.93, which indicates the scale has good convergent validity; after the seven factors being paired with each other, the chi-square value differences between constrained and unconstrained models all reach the significant level of 0.05, which indicates the scale has good discriminant validity.&rdquo;</p>

The participants of study were 665 elementary preservice science teachers (467 females, 198 males) from 7 colleges in Turkey. The proposed model based on educational technology literature was tested using structural equation modeling. The model testing results revealed that preservice teachers&rsquo; technology competencies and experiences mediated the relation of technology ownership to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs. The direct relation of their possession of technology to their TPACK self efficacy beliefs was insignificant while the indirect relation through their technology competencies and experiences was significant. The results also indicated there were significant direct effects of preservice teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards technology use, technology competencies, and experiences on their TPACK self efficacy beliefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study was conducted to explore the Saudi Arabian science and mathematics primary school pre-service teachers&rsquo; perceptions and practices of the integration of technology in the classroom. As their practice takes place within two different institutions (University and school) each has its own policy and agenda, the complexity of their practice environment rises and the context might become problematic. Thus, both personal and contextual factors within these two institutions were explored to draw a whole picture of the issue according to the sociocultural theory as the theoretical framework of the study. Case study was adopted as the research methodology using Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) questionnaire, classroom observation and semi-structured interviews to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample consisted of 15 participants; seven primary school pre-service teachers (science and mathematics), four university tutors and four head teachers. Two different categories of the pre-service teachers were identified; users and non-users of technology. Interestingly, those who used technology were found to adopt traditional transmission strategy of teaching. They perceived h5 agency assuming that their role is to transfer knowledge to passive learners through visual technology. In contrast, those who did not use technology assumed more active role by the pupils. Therefore, they thought visual technologies are not appropriate tools for a learner-centred strategy of teaching showing less awareness about the affordances that this type of technology could provide. Accessing guidance during teaching practice was found to be a significant element that could allow pre-service teachers to learn properly within their zone of proximal development and contribute considerably to their pedagogical identity development and their understanding of agency in the classroom. Moreover, teaching subject was found to be an important factor in shaping the pre-service teachers&rsquo; identity and practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine Kuwaiti mathematical elementary teachers&rsquo; perceptions about their ability to integrate M-learning (mobile learning) into their current teaching practices and the major barriers hindering teachers&rsquo; ability to create an M-learning environment. Furthermore, this study sought to understand teachers&rsquo; perceptions about their ability to create a collaborative cloud-computing learning environment that corresponds with the 21st century skills and possibly explain their readiness for future reformation of education in Kuwait.<br />Using an Internet-based format to this study quantitative and qualitative data, the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and barriers survey gleaned quantitative information about how mathematics teachers and a head of a mathematics department (n = 562) viewed use of technology as well as the barriers they faced in integrating it into the classroom. Also, qualitative data were collected using a survey of open-ended questions to provide context to survey answers and better understand the barriers and affordance experienced by the participants. Moreover, a 21st century open-ended questionnaire was employed to collect qualitative information from mathematics teachers and head of the departments (n = 21) in regard to their ability to construct a 21st century learning environment based on collaboration and constructivist perspective utilizing a cloud-computing technology. Quantitative analysis was utilized to examine elementary mathematics teachers&rsquo; perceptions using the TPACK survey, and the validity and reliability of the TPACK subscales were computed by administering the confirmatory factor analysis. Factors that were elicited were specified as: all seven subscales encompassed in the TPACK survey significantly fit model of factor structures, and the TPACK survey was reliable and valid. In addition, descriptive analysis such as the TPACK subscale means and standard deviations were computed via the SPSS software. Qualitative content analysis was used to understand teachers&rsquo; perceptions about their ability to integrate mobile technology, perceptions of the primary barriers and affordance that limited their ability, and their perceptions of their ability to integrate collaborative cloud computing and create a 21st century learning environment based on the constructivist perspective. When analyzed, the self-reported open-ended survey yielded the following specific themes: (a) teachers perceived themselves high in their ability to integrate mobile technology; (b) the primary barriers based on teachers&rsquo; perceptions were budget constraints, IT limitations, time constraints, and administrative support; and (c) teachers perceived themselves high in their ability to integrate collaborative cloud computing to construct a 21st century learning environment based on the constructivist perspective. This study finding could be implemented to create a new modern mathematics elementary curriculum that resolves the current curriculum issues. Future research is recommended in the direction of creating a new mathematical curriculum based on administrators&rsquo;, parents&rsquo;, and students&rsquo; perspectives.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;There is a continuous increase in the English Language Learner (ELL) population in the United States contributing to a growing achievement gap. The ELL population in California is higher than the rest of the nation but California ELL students continue to underperform. This study argues that second language acquisition teaching strategies and methods must change to meet growing demand particularly in the areas of Language Arts and Mathematics. The theoretical framework for this study was Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) and Sociocultural Learning. To achieve the three dimensions of TPCK, educators utilized hybrid teaching methods. A California school district with a high population of ELLs agreed to employ this study&rsquo;s prescribed curriculum for mathematics in random classrooms. The imposed approach for blended learning had multiple facets. The tool used to demonstrate the technological knowledge of TPCK was the ALEKS mathematics computer program. Simultaneously, teachers engaged students in small groups to achieve pedagogical knowledge . The final area of content knowledge aligned with Common Core State Standards. The researcher used mixed methods sequential explanatory research design and established that blended learning works. Using paired sample t-tests and focus groups, this study found statistically significant data of increased mathematical academic achievement of the ELLs in the test classrooms where blended learning was utilized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The focus of this PhD study is teachers&rsquo; knowledge and how it is involved in interacting with technology to produce the mathematical knowledge made available in the classroom. Contrasting connectionist and transmissionist teachers&rsquo; use of technology provides a means of making such knowledge visible, allowing an exploration of the nature and content of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology. In addition, this study examines how and to what extent the mathematical knowledge made available through a teacher&rsquo;s interaction with technology is distributed across the teacher and technology. The first, quantitative phase of the project surveyed English secondary mathematics teachers&rsquo; use of technology (n=183). Using Rasch analysis to construct a transmissionist measure of self-reported pedagogic practice, a surprising association is found between frequent use of teacher-centred software and a more connectionist orientation. The survey data also suggests that &lsquo;teacher-centred&rsquo; practices involving ICT may instead be construed as &lsquo;dominant&rsquo; practices, since they are most frequently occurring across all teachers. In the second, qualitative phase of the project, two connectionist and two transmissionist teachers were selected as case studies on the basis of their responses to the survey instrument. Data collection involved a semi-structured interview based around a GeoGebra file on circle theorems, two classroom observations and postobservation interviews. Data analysis using the TPACK framework suggests the nature of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology as abstract, mathematical knowledge and yet simultaneously as mathematical knowledge situated in the context of teaching using technology. Using the Knowledge Quartet, a conceptualisation of the content of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology in relation to the topic of circle theorems is developed, demonstrating the highly complex nature of such knowledge. Ameliorating this complexity, this study provides indications of how a distributed view of cognition might offer potential strategies for facilitating teacher interaction with technology.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;While digital technologies have been recognized as a necessary part of school learning, a digital divide persists between those who have technological access and those without technological access. African American children in impoverished, urban areas may lack the same opportunities to use technology as children in higher socioeconomic status (SES) areas. Research demonstrates that schools may serve as an equalizer in bridging this digital divide. Thus, students who attend schools in low SES comminuties can benefit from the integration of Digital Literacies (DL) during literacy instruction. This qualitative study examined how teachers in an urban, low SES school struggled to utilize DL in ways that challenged traditional literacy practices. To understand these struggles, this study examined how elementary teachers within this demographic used DL in response to the demands for technology during literacy instruction. Guiding questions included: a) What pedagogical practices do teachers of African American children in urban, low SES classrooms use when integrating digital tools during their literacy instruction? b) How do these teachers&rsquo; perceptions of Digital Literacies&rsquo;s usefulness impact the ways they use Digital Literacies during their literacy instruction? c) What challenges do the teachers face and how do they respond to these challenges as they integrate Digital Literacies in their classrooms? Data collected included observations of teachers during Digital Literacies lessons, individual and focus group interviews, audio-journals entires, curriculum maps, and lesson plans. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method to allow themes to emerge. Results from this qualitative study revealed that teachers exhibited three levels of Implementation of DL, including Limited, Moderate, and Full Implementation. Examination of teachers&rsquo; pedagogical practices using the TPACK rubric and the SAMR model of integration revealed that a teachers&rsquo;s willingness to implement DL is dependent upon variations in the level of DL knowledge and intangible variables such as a teacher&rsquo;s beliefs toward technology, a teachers&rsquo; comfort level, and the teacher&rsquo;s response to challenges that occur. This study&rsquo;s aimed to provide valuable information to the existing body of research on DL for teachers of African American students.&rdquo;</p>

Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, Belfast, Ireland. Abstract retrieved from http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.706290</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology was highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development and the United Nations Educational Organisation as an important feature in teacher professional development. Both Organisations stressed the importance of teachers having pedagogical understanding of its uses rather than simply being trained to integrate it into classroom practice. The Teaching Council of Ireland responded to this by developing policy on the Continuum of Teacher Education (CPD), aimed at enabling teachers to develop innovative methodologies including technology integration. This inquiry builds on in-school CPD using a framework known as Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) within a situational learning environment. The methodological approach is positioned within digital narrative inquiry concentrating on the narration of four teachers across the curriculum. The design comprises two forms of story by each teacher as data. The first is an instructional digital story for use in a curriculum lesson, while the second is a reflection on the experience of creating and using the instructional digital story. Each teacher&rsquo;s narrative is presented after using a thematic analysis in relation to the TPACK framework, challenges and opportunities. The findings indicate professional development of learning a new technology tool such as Digital Story depends on a teachers ability to see a clear connection between the technology and content as well as its pedagogical uses. The style of instructional story created by each teacher is influenced by personal belief in the value of storytelling for instruction and the appropriateness of its use in certain areas of the curriculum. Common challenges focused on time needed to create, use of personal voice recordings and image selection. Rewards indicated increased self efficacy, greater student engagement and acceleration of learning. The situational learning environment developed enthusiasm to create future Digital Stories and aroused interest from other teachers in the school.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Rural areas have less technology access due to an inadequate amount of income and limited internet bandwidth availabilities, perpetuating the digital gap between rural schools and schools in urban or suburban locations. The problem addressed in this study is that U.S. legislation requires all public school students to be prepared to function in a technology-driven society, yet socio-economically disadvantaged students and parents are less likely to have technology access outside of school. The purpose of this qualitative case study was two-fold, and sought to investigate rural elementary teachers&rsquo; experiences of: 1) utilizing technology to teach low socio-economic students with diverse needs and little or no technology access outside of school; and, 2) using technology in parent-teacher conferences with parents who have limited or no technology in the home. The sample included ten teacher participants. All participants are certified teachers currently employed at the rural school study site teaching in grades first through fifth. Participants completed an open-ended, qualitative, online questionnaire about technology practices in the classroom. Findings revealed that there were barriers with the quality, rather than the quantity of technology used in rural, low-income schools, which included slower internet speeds and technology delivery issues. Barriers to communication with families included family&rsquo;s lack of cell phone access and affordability. Despite technology barriers, it was found that technology increased student engagement and motivation in learning. One suggestion for future research is to conduct a quantitative study to assess technology usage in rural schools within low income communities in the state where this study was conducted and in rural areas across America.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is understood that principals play a key role the integration of computer technology their schools, however there have been limited studies exploring the level of technology knowledge and technology leadership skills possessed by school principals and how these measures relate to each other. Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is a popular framework for understanding the teacher knowledge required for effective technology integration. This framework has been used to study a number of different populations including pre-service and in-service teachers in a variety of grade levels, subject areas, and pedagogical contexts. This is the first time this framework has been applied to school principals. Technology leadership capacity for this study was defined by the ISTE Standards for Administrators, which define the skills school leaders need to support the successful use and integration of computer technology.<br />The purpose of this study was to adapt and apply the TPACK framework to school principals, to measure the technology leadership skills of those principals, and to identify whether a relationship exists between the measures. This study employed two distinct survey instruments that were delivered online. The Principal TPACK Survey used in this study was adapted from an existing TPACK survey by Schmidt et al. (2009). The Technology Leadership Inventory (TLI) is an original instrument developed to align with and measure the leadership skills represented in the ISTE Standards for Administrators.<br />In addition to providing baseline data for principal TPACK and principal technology leadership capacities, results indicate a h5 positive correlation between TPACK and their technology leadership capacities. Additionally, results indicate principals are more knowledgeable of more traditional, non-technological conceptions of pedagogy and content. Finally, because of the h5 correlation between the two measures, it is recommended that in order to improve the technology leadership ability of principals, special consideration should be given to building knowledge emphasizing the connection between technology, pedagogy, and content that is specific to classroom contexts rather than more managerial applications.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine administrator, student, and teacher perceptions of organizational structures, systems, and supports implemented to aid technology integration, and the potential for that technology integration to achieve 21st century skill acquisition and deeper learning in a 1:1 environment. The Diffusion of Innovation Theoretical Framework guided the design and analysis of this study. Further, a literature review of the integration of technology into content and pedagogy informed this study. The overarching research question for this study asked how teachers, students, and administrators perceive the implementation of a 1:1 district-wide implementation initiative, and its impact on 21st century skill acquisition and deeper learning. As such, the study sought to answer the following questions: (1) How has the district organized itself to support technology integration by teachers with the specific intent of fostering deeper learning and 21st century skills? and (2) How do administrators, teachers, and students perceive the implementation of 1:1 and its impact on 21st century skills and deeper learning? An instrumental case study approach was used to explore and describe the perceptions of administrators, students and teachers using rich quote of their experiences. It is evident that the purposeful integration of technology in the 1:1 environment led to student acquisition of 21st century skills and deeper learning at the study site. In addition, the study revealed structures and supports necessary to facilitate 1:1 programs to foster deeper learning and 21st century skills including h5 communication, robust infrastructure, long-range planning, stakeholder engagement, professional learning, collaboration and time. The findings of this study, along with the identification and analysis of related themes, have the potential to inform similar districts as they embark on the implementation of 1:1 programs to foster 21st century skills and deeper learning competencies.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;There are a variety of factors that can facilitate or constrain technology use in classrooms (Hew &amp; Brush, 2006). Using a modified version of the framework for Conditions for Classroom Technology Innovations (Zhao et al., 2002), this study explored how the innovator, innovation, and context impact technology use in four K-5 elementary schools. The TPACK framework was used to analyze teacher knowledge and support structures (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Research has called for more contextualized studies in schools, that include stakeholders like teachers and administrators, and that focus on supports like vision, access to technology, training, collaboration, and technical support. Of particular importance is not just the availability of these supports but how well they flexibly and responsively meet the needs of teachers (Granger et al., 2002; Rutkowski et al., 2011). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a program evaluation to determine the needs of teachers using the framework so the district could improve context supports to better meet teacher needs and improve teaching practices. Study participants included fifty-eight teachers who participated in a survey&mdash;twenty of whom also participated in focus groups. Other relevant stakeholders included technology coaches, principals, tech support personnel, and central office administrators who participated in interviews or focus groups. The findings established a wide variety of needs that could benefit from greater responsiveness from the supports the district has established. The innovators demonstrated a need for more ongoing, detailed training for basic technical knowledge before widespread integration at the level of TPACK could be established. With increased access to a variety of technologies, &ldquo;easy and efficient&rdquo; use is needed if teachers are going to be able to properly integrate the number of tools that are becoming available to them due to decreased costs for new technology. Also important were underlying beliefs that were hindering greater technology integration, particularly with decentralizing the classroom for more student-centered practices. Teachers had a variety of &ldquo;distances&rdquo; between themselves and technology, and between the desired technology practices and their current practices. The implications call for the district to more purposely use teachers&rsquo; needs to drive the flexible supports it already has in place. This includes articulating a short-term vision and improving the coordination of support structures to help all teachers meet the vision. Those supports would involve ongoing discussions about teacher pedagogical beliefs, increased coaching during the school day, structured collaboration to meet the vision, and more ongoing training for basic technical knowledge. This study shows the importance of using all relevant stakeholders to evaluate a program for improved practices and to use teacher needs to coordinate improved context supports.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;For decades, there has been a nationwide demand to increase the number of science teachers in K-12 education (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983; National Research Council [NRC], 2007). This demand is in large part due to increases in state science graduation requirements. Teacher preparation programs have been preparing new science teachers on pace with the resulting increase in demand (Ingersoll &amp; Merrill, 2010), however, shortages have continued as up to 50% of these new teachers leave the profession within their first five years of teaching (Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004), creating a &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; phenomenon as districts scramble to address this early attrition with yet more beginning teachers. We need to address what Ingersoll (2012) describes as the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the teaching force: the fact that an increasingly large segment of the teaching force is comprised of beginning teachers who are at a high risk of leaving the profession.<br />The three related studies that comprise this dissertation focus on the role of technological interventions for in-service and pre-service science teachers. The context for the first two studies is TIN, an online induction program for beginning secondary science teachers. These two studies consider the impact of technological supports on the reflective practice of participating teachers. The design interventions included VideoANT (an online video annotation tool) and Teachers as Leaders roles (a structured response protocol) for the Venture/Vexation online forum activity. The context for the third study is T3-S, a university licensure course for pre-service science teachers designed to explore technology integration in secondary science classrooms. This study investigated the impact of pre-service teacher participation in the creation of an Adventure Learning (AL) environment (Doering, 2006) on their understanding of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and its role in their future science instruction. The supporting interventions took the form of three separate groups of pre-service teachers, each tasked with a specific role in the creation of the AL environment.<br />Findings from the first two studies indicate that specific, explicit supports for teacher discourse in TIN activities is needed in order to foster the reflective practice that course designers and instructor-facilitators desire. The third study reveals that pre-service teacher participation in the creation of an AL environment supported their understanding of the nature of TPACK and allowed them to define their content-based technology pedagogy for future science instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Nikolaraizi, Verkiri and Easterbrooks (2013) documented how deaf learners can benefit from the use of visual supports in the classroom. Technology provides the tools to create a robust visual learning environment (Smith &amp; Okolo, 2010). For teachers to facilitate learning in a technology rich environment, they themselves must be comfortable with the tools and understand how to effectively integrate their use into curricular delivery. This project examines the design, implementation and evaluation of a professional development program that was created to educate deaf education teachers about the use of the educational software, Clicker6. The Clicker6 Professional Development program was designed specifically to integrate the use of technology with the newly adapted bilingual curricular approach to teaching English Language Arts (ELA). The Clicker6 Professional Development Program consists of four teacher improvement goals: (1) to build competency in the use of the Clicker6 software; (2) to promote understanding of the connection among Clicker6 software, literacy content and pedagogy; (3) to provide time to create instructional classroom materials in Clicker6 directly aligned to teachers&rsquo; curriculum goal; (4) to support teachers&rsquo; continuing training as they implement Clicker6 in the classroom. Following teacher participation in the program, an investigation was conducted to understand and characterize the impact of the program on teacher learning. Specifically, this effort focused on three key questions: (1) What impact did the Clicker6 professional development program have on the teachers&rsquo; technical ability to operate the software?; (2) How did participation in the Clicker6 training influence teachers&rsquo; use of the software in relation to English Language Arts (ELA) curricular content in the classroom?; and (3) What were the teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the Clicker6 professional development program? Fifteen English language arts (ELA) teachers participated in the Clicker6 professional development program. Four sessions of training were offered during a single in-service day, and focused upon use of Clicker6 software as a classroom instructional tool. The program continued the following week with an in-class support session in which the facilitator offered assistance while the teacher used the technology in the classroom. Approximately two weeks after the initial professional development sessions, the teachers met together with the facilitator for 45 minutes of support follow-up. Data were collected through surveys, observations, and interviews. Survey data examined changes in Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) among teachers before and after their participation in the professional development. Observation rubrics were used to assess the teachers&rsquo; demonstrated ability in the use of the software as a result of the professional development. Finally, interviews were used to collect qualitative data regarding teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the professional development program.<br />Findings indicated that teachers were positive regarding the Clicker6 professional development offering. Further, findings suggested an increase in teachers&rsquo; capacity to technically operate the Clicker6 software and integrate it into their curriculum following the training. Recommendations were made in regard to planning and design of future technology-related professional development with the goal of improving its effectiveness. These include: (a) provide multiple sections of training based on teachers&rsquo; technology competency; (b) schedule sessions over the course of a school year; (c) provide monthly email communication with tips and tutorials; (d) schedule teacher-to-teacher observations of the use of Clicker6 in the classroom setting; (e) expand professional development for other subject areas; (f) add a session on managing student use of the software; and (g) add a session on technical trouble shooting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teachers need training to integrate technology into classroom curriculum, activities, and pedagogy. The adoption of the Common Core State Standards and statewide computer based assessments, coupled with technology&rsquo;s rapid rate of innovation and change, has only increased the need to help support teachers&rsquo; development of these necessary skills. The purpose of this project was to create an online-based e-learning professional development training module for teachers to develop their technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and skills. The design of the training module incorporated e-learning design principles, adult learning principles, and current research on developing teachers&rsquo; TPACK. To provide feedback on the design, teachers from two middle schools in Southern California were invited to use the training module, and were surveyed regarding their experiences. Results of the survey indicate participants gained knowledge and skills for using their school computer lab, integrating technology into their classroom instruction, and overall, were pleased with the e-learning training module.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The veteran secondary teacher is a valuable asset in the educational field, yet has not been the focus of predominant research studies in regard to attitudes, beliefs, and experiences with technology integration. This study utilized the Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design, which was implemented in two phases. The research was designed to investigate how veteran secondary teachers in a Southwest Florida public school district are being affected by the pedagogical movement concerning the integration of educational technology. In phase one of the study, quantitative data was collected from 97 veteran secondary teachers at five secondary schools utilizing the online Teachers&rsquo; Use and Perceptions Survey (TUPS), developed by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida. In phase two, convenience sampling was used to select 10 teachers from the veteran secondary teachers who participated in the survey. Qualitative data was collected during face-to-face interviews which utilized open-ended interview questions that were developed following an analysis of the survey results. Overall, veteran secondary teachers&rsquo; perceptions were positive; they believe that technology enhances their teaching, perceive the benefits of technology in terms of supporting their classroom instruction, and feel h5ly that student use of technology enhances students&rsquo; performance. Most veteran secondary teachers indicated they feel comfortable using technology in their teaching and believe they use technology effectively in their teaching for instructional delivery, as a communication tool, and for students&rsquo; independent learning. These teachers also indicated a need for comprehensive technology training, a supportive learning network, opportunities to explore technology applications, and time to plan for technology integration as a pedagogical strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s K-12 educational environment with the newly adopted Common Core State Standards (CCSS), improving student literacy as a foundational skill to obtain success in all other subject areas is one of the most important goals. Unfortunately, many literature curricula suffer from a lack of innovative pedagogy despite the introduction of various educational technologies meant to aid student learning. This study focused on developing a new game-based constructionist pedagogical model for literature education using tabletop role-playing game creation. Using Shulman&rsquo;s (1987) Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) that eventually evolved into Mishra and Kohler&rsquo;s (2006) Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) as the main theoretical framework, this design-based research showed how tabletop role-playing game creation as a constructionist pedagogical strategy successfully helped high school students to receive the benefits of high quality literature education.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multiple case study examines four groups of secondary mathematics teachers engaged in a Lesson Study approach to professional development where they planned and taught lessons that integrate technology. Informed by current literature, a framework was developed to focus on the dimensions of teacher&rsquo;s knowledge to teach mathematics with technology that appear to influence teacher&rsquo;s decisions during lesson planning. These dimensions of teacher&rsquo;s knowledge include knowledge of mathematics, knowledge of pedagogy, knowledge of technology, and other types of knowledge that are developed by the interactions of those. At the beginning and end of the Lesson Study, quantitative data was collected using a pre-post survey to measure changes in teacher&rsquo;s self-perceptions of the knowledge to teach mathematics with technology. Qualitative data was collected as the groups engaged in designing a mathematical lesson, as a volunteer teacher from each group implemented that lesson, and as a group reflected in the planning and implementation of the lesson. This includes audio recordings, video recordings, and field notes. Results of this study demonstrate that when teachers are engaged in professional development activities that are focused on having teachers plan thoughtful and detailed lessons that integrate technology, their self-perceptions of their mathematical knowledge (MK), technological knowledge (TK), and technological, pedagogical, and mathematical knowledge (TPACK) increases significantly. Finding suggests that professional development opportunities where teachers collaborate with colleagues could motivate the integration of technology tools into teaching, and could stimulate changes to pedagogical approaches. Findings also suggest that when teachers exhibit appropriate mathematical knowledge, and have in-depth discussions about the pedagogical approach to take, the integration of technology seemed to flow naturally. Findings also suggest that when teachers seemed to lack mathematical understanding of the topic being taught, and are not willing or motivated to change their pedagogical approaches, they do not use technology in ways that can potentially impact students&rsquo; engagement with mathematical ideas.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multiple case study explored how secondary-level co-teachers hold, build, and share knowledge related to technology integration. Co-teaching, a special education service delivery model, involves a general and special educator who share responsibility for planning, delivering, and assessing instruction (Friend, 2014). Through the lens of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), I explored the perspectives and experiences of four co-teaching pairs who regularly integrated technology into instruction. Study results suggested that these teachers held knowledge, beliefs, and values that influenced their classroom practices. The micro-level contextual elements in the teachers&rsquo; workplaces, along with meso-levels supports, influenced how the teachers built and shared knowledge with and from each other. Their collaborative relationships, which were based upon parity, respect, and communication, supported a professional work environment of sharing and learning. As these teachers engaged in dialogue within their teaching and learning partnerships, individually-held knowledge (TPACK) was distributed between the co-teachers. Content-, grade-, and school-level collaborations addressing technology integration also resulted in the distribution of TPACK school-wide. Implications of these results include recommendations for how school leaders may support effective co-teaching, which can enhance teachers&rsquo; professional learning related to technology integration and encourage the development of distributed knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of the study was to examine the role of leadership and school culture on the integration of technology to support instruction for students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). A multiple embedded case study design was used to describe how a school leadership team supports a school culture for technology integration within classrooms where special education teachers integrate technology to engage students with EBD. The primary case of school culture includes a comprehensive quote of how the school leadership team supports a culture for technology integration within classrooms. Embedded cases within the primary case describe how special education teachers integrate technology to engage students with EBD in classroom instruction. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2005) is part of the conceptual framework to theoretically undergird the study. The findings of this study describe a school that serves students with EBD where there is a h5 school culture and leaders support teachers who integrate technology to engage students. Patterns from the analysis indicate school leaders plan for staff development, participate in staff development sessions with teachers, observe teachers, provide feedback about teacher performance, and praise and encourage teachers to integrate technology. Teachers and leaders engage in formal and informal staff development opportunities to learn how to integrate technology into classroom lessons. As a result of these trainings and school leader support, teachers provide clear expectations for students while integrating technology to engage students, provide direct instruction, choices, and visual representation of content.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Purpose and Method of Study<br />This study analyzed the technology integration practices of faculty in the Louisiana Community and Technical College System using a conceptual framework that considers expertise in technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge. In this quantitative descriptive study, the TPACK Confidence survey was administered to 225 faculty in 11 community and technical colleges in Louisiana. The instrument included attitudinal questions and two demographic questions.</p>
<p>Findings and Conclusions<br />Faculty reported that they were very interested in using information and communications technology (ICT) in teaching and learning, but they were not very confident in using ICT to enhance their teaching. It was also indicated that faculty had positive attitudes toward using ICT in teaching and learning, but they were only somewhat confident in using it in instruction to transform their teaching and learning activities. Faculty also reported that they were confident in their digital technology knowledge and the foundational competencies measured by the TPACK Vocational Self-efficacy scale. In addition, they indicated high levels of access to basic forms of ICT, but only limited access to the newer forms of ICT. Faculty expressed competence in using common applications such as word processing, desktop publishing, presentation software, spreadsheets, and email. However, significant differences were found between departments for the use of ICT to enhance teaching and learning, to transform teaching and learning, interests and attitudes toward using ICT, access to different forms of ICT, digital technology knowledge, and competence in using some ICT applications. The study concluded that technology training for faculty should be discipline specific.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;To satisfy demand for online learning opportunities at the high school level, 3 school districts in the northeast United States established a consortium to share resources to develop and deliver online courses. High school teachers who volunteered to develop courses for the consortium attempted the task without previous training in online course design and facilitation. High school students enrolled in the courses often did not successfully complete them, which obstructed the mission of the consortium. The purpose of this qualitative single critical case study was to explore teachers&rsquo; experiences with and perceptions of designing and developing online courses without accompanying professional development. The iNACOL National Standards for Quality Online Courses (v2) and technological, pedagogical, content knowledge (TPACK) served as the conceptual frameworks for the study. Five teachers who developed and facilitated an online course for the consortium, without companion professional development, volunteered to be interviewed. Data were reduced using NVivo software and analyzed using a priori codes based on NACOL standards then open-coded for emerging themes. Results indicated that other than content expertise, teachers did not believe they had sufficient competencies in any of the areas identified in the iNACOL standards. Based on these results, an online professional development course for teachers was designed to provide introductory training and to model elements of quality online course design using the Moodle learning management system. Positive social change may be achieved if teachers have the knowledge and skills required to develop high-caliber, innovative, and convenient education opportunities that encourage students&rsquo; course completion which leads to learning and academic success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Education is constantly evolving, facing new demands from changing standards in a competitive global society. California K&ndash;12 schools are now navigating greater demands for technology integration from the Common Core State Standards and NGSS to develop students&rsquo; 21st-century skills and improve learning outcomes. The focus of this case study was to identify the decisions, actions, and leadership taken by one school to embrace technology as a tool for instruction. Multiple data collection methods were implemented, including a staff survey, participant interviews, observations, and review of documents for triangulation. The study used the TPACK framework as a conceptual model to guide the investigation. The results from this qualitative case study indicated that key factors to creating a school that embraces technology include: collaboration among teachers, administration, and the district; a shared vision; having the right people on board; continuous and effective technology professional development; building teacher capacity; and having a h5 collaborative leadership team. In addition, the findings suggested that technology implementation can be led by the school district when all stakeholders are taken into consideration with each decision and action for dissemination of resources and professional development (PD). This case study seeks to further practitioners&rsquo; and policymakers&rsquo; understanding of what the technology implementation process looks like in transforming teacher instruction and student learning.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This mixed-method multiple-case study explores the ways successful teaching with the iPad in a one-to-one classroom setting is aligned with the TPACK framework. The research was conducted at a college-preparatory high school with a two-year history of teaching and learning with the iPad. A teacher was selected from each of the following content areas: English, mathematics, history and biology. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, lesson plan documents, direct classroom observations, and a survey. The qualitative data was analyzed using the Atlas.ti software and the quantitative data using the methods of descriptive statistics. In the cross-case analysis both qualitative and quantitative data were compared and contrasted with the theoretical TPACK framework and the findings of other research studies measuring the TPACK construct.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Several studies suggest that if evidence-based school innovations are to be successful, schools must possess adequate capacity to implement them with quality. This paper utilizes a framework of organizational readiness called R=MC2 , positing that readiness to implement with quality consists of three components: general capacities, innovation-specific capacities, and motivation. Specifically, this paper investigates whether certain key characteristics of professional development (active learning, integration, time for practice, collaboration, tailoring, coaching, and provision of feedback) can impact teacher motivation to implement novel educational practices. The paper answers two major research questions: 1) Which characteristics of quality professional development (PD) are related to each of the components of motivation described in the R=MC2 model? and 2) Is motivation a significant mediator of the relation between quality professional development and teacher implementation of new practices? Data for this study were collected from a district-wide one-to-one computing initiative in a Southeastern school district. The purpose of the initiative was to provide each student in grades 3-12 with a personal laptop or tablet, with the goal of increasing personalized, authentic, collaborative, and tech-integrated (PAC-Tech) learning in the district. Data were collected from two sources: 1,509 teachers completed a survey relating to PD at their school, their motivation to implement the initiative, and their use of PAC-Tech learning in the classroom. In addition, four district-level Technology Integration Specialists (TIS) provided data concerning PD quality at each of the district&rsquo;s schools as a secondary source of data. Mediation analyses revealed that motivation was a significant mediator of the relation between PD quality and teacher implementation quality. Using multi-level regression, analyses suggest that the most influential characteristics of PD on motivation are 1) integration of new ideas with teachers&rsquo; existing knowledge, 2) tailoring PD to teachers&rsquo; individual needs and preferences, 3) providing opportunities for collaboration among teachers, and 4) providing consistent feedback to teachers. Thus, the present results predict that schools that design PD that integrates new and familiar concepts to make it easy for teachers to learn a new practice, that allow teachers to work together in learning that practice, that provide feedback to teachers during the learning process, and that survey teachers about their specific needs, preferences, and learning styles are more likely to secure buy-in and support from teachers for a particular innovation. Further, this buy-in is subsequently related to the likelihood and quality of teacher implementation of that innovation. These results are likely to be of interest to schools and school districts seeking to enhance implementation of educational innovations and increase teacher buy-in for using novel, evidence-based strategies.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to analyze the lesson plans of high school teachers for technology integration in high-stake tested and non-tested contexts. The aim of this research was to provide information and recommendations to educators of the district concerning the planning of lessons and integration of technology in high-stake subject contexts. The data collected provided information regarding a teacher&rsquo;s planning of lessons that integrated technology in high-stake tested and non-tested subjects. A TPACK- Based Technology Integration Assessment Rubric was used to evaluate the lesson planning of 435 teachers in English and Science subjects in either a high-stake tested or non-tested context. ANOVA testing was completed to measure statistically the differences among the lesson planning within the same subject area and context while t-tests were completed for comparison between high-stake tested and non-tested subjects for Science and English. The results of the study indicated that technology integration was influenced by context when comparing high-stake tested Biology with non-tested Science subjects. In contrast, results between high-stake tested and non-tested English subjects did not support the hypothesis that a high-stake tested context was a barrier to technology integration. Based on these results, a Six-Step Growth Design Process was developed to further investigate the influence of subject and individual teacher planning habitus upon the high-stake context barrier to technology integration. The Six-Step Growth Design Process will be implemented to increase technology integration in the classroom and improve its use in different contexts. The process will allow educators to examine the application of technology and reflect upon instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Public school teachers within a Pennsylvania intermediate unitare receiving inadequate job-embedded professional development that recognizes knowledge of content, pedagogy, and technology integration, as outlined by Mishra and Koehler&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (2006). A school environment where teachers are expected to educate themselves on how to integrate technology into the classroom will not adequately produce students for today&rsquo;s digital world. The purpose of this study was to relate differences in the technology integration of K-12 public school teachers to the adoption of the TPACK framework into a school district&rsquo;s professional development model. This mixed methods constructivist/interpretivist case study assessed the efficacy of professional development of K-12 public school teachers on their practice of integrating the TPACK framework. The proposed research explained how the technology integration of individual teachers is affected by professional development offered, measured how the teachers&rsquo; practice of integrating the TPACK framework relates to the professional development offered, and identified best practices for professional development.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates instructional moves by teachers in mathematics classrooms in which technology-based activities (i.e., student-oriented simulations) and features of those simulations influence classroom practices. Four teachers were studied over the course of a year as an exploratory study to build interpretive cases that described instructional practices in technology-based lessons. Teachers developed lessons using PhET simulations designed to support algebraic reasoning. Data sources included teachers&rsquo; process of selecting and designing lessons, observations of teachers&rsquo; non-technology and technology-based mathematical activities, and teacher interviews and reflections.</p>
<p>This work was based on a conceptual framework blending the ideas of Mathematical Tasks (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 1998), Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), in which teachers&rsquo; instructional practices are determined by teachers&rsquo; mathematical pedagogical content knowledge, task selection and design, and use of technology.</p>
<p>Results indicated that teachers see simulations as having significant benefits in the classroom. Teachers leveraged these opportunities by increasing class discussions, engaging in higher levels of thinking and reasoning, and focusing on mathematical representations. When teachers used simulations, the teachers spent less time in direct instruction, focused more on the mathematics, and focused more on investigations rather than drill-oriented tasks.</p>
<p>Technology in the classroom, however, was problematic for some teachers. The very nature of students working independently with their own devices meant that student-student interactions decreased in some lessons. Furthermore, teachers&rsquo; discomfort in managing technology seems to limit ongoing use.</p>
<p>Specific features of the simulations that prompted instructional moves included the ability to support conceptual understanding and build student engagement. Simulations also provided a &lsquo;low floor, high ceiling,&rsquo; supporting differentiation, and a dynamic responsiveness, facilitating connections between representations. On the other hand, teachers raised concerns that some features of the simulation could do the math for the students. Furthermore, the perception of simulations as being a game may impact how and when simulations are used.</p>
<p>The emergent use of technology in math classrooms is under-supported. For simulations to be used in a more extensive fashion in mathematics classes, professional development and curricular materials are needed to support implementation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This dissertation investigates the application of instructional technology within the specific context of popular music education. Synthesizing the work of Mishra &amp; Koehler (2006) and Bauer (2014), this dissertation operationalizes a broader, more contemporary definition of instructional technology that goes beyond the traditional conception of mere instructional tool towards one that is more protean, unstable, and opaque. Research questions about technology&rsquo;s impact on music education are central to this curriculum study and evolve into considerations on how the relationship of popular music and instructional technology shape a pedagogy for popular music education. Making use of principles rooted in aesthetic education, critical pedagogy, and TPACK, the curriculum created fulfills the requirements of an undergraduate program in music education mapped onto the National Association of Schools of Music standards. Presented along with a standards map are course overviews, syllabi, and lesson plans that specifically make use of the theoretical backgrounds discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The practice of students bringing their own device to school BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) has now become reasonably common in New Zealand primary schools after being first introduced in the late 1990s. It has become a strategy that schools can use to provide 21st century learning opportunities for students without having to provide school-&shy;‐owned devices. This study raises important questions for teachers and schools to ask themselves before implementing BYOD.<br />This study explores the experiences of three New Zealand primary school teachers as they introduce BYOD into their classrooms. The case study sought to understand what factors impacted on their ability to implement new pedagogical practices and how professional learning might help support teachers with BYOD.<br />The literature review examines national and international literature on the implementation and impact of BYOD. It discusses how and why teachers do or do not engage with ICT in classrooms and how BYOD impacts on their practice. This case study utilises SAMR (Puentedura, 2006) and TPACK (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) in order to analyse the data and discuss the findings. The findings suggest that, in order for teachers to maximise the potential of BYOD, professional learning and technical support is essential. The teachers experienced a number of challenges as they introduced BYOD, yet all managed to persevere and remain positive as they trialled new teaching methods, and utilised new programs and applications.<br />The study concludes by making a number of pertinent recommendations that can be actioned by schools in order to ensure implementation is smooth and successful. It is very important that teachers are supported adequately by the school and are given opportunities to engage in relevant and timely professional learning.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology is becoming quite pervasive in society at large. Its integration into secondary schools and its use with curriculum requires a unique knowledge of its purposeful articulation as it relates to curriculum goals and student outcomes. Therefore, this study will focus on how an educator&rsquo;s decision-making process determines how technology will be integrated within the planning process of secondary educators, and how these decisions may be affected by an educator&rsquo;s technological pedagogical content knowledge, otherwise known as TPACK.<br />Qualitative analysis was then used to evaluate a Technology Integration Rationale (TIR) that was produced by members of a rural professional development cohort. Qualitative analysis was also conducted on transcribed face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The TIR and the interviews involved a cohort representing a rural school district who attended a professional development course that was facilitated by a University in the Rocky Mountain West. The TIR was then scored using a valid rubric to measure an educator&rsquo;s TPACK score. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were transcribed by hand to gain a sense of an educator&rsquo;s understanding of the TPACK framework as it relates to the purposeful use of technology in lesson decision-making.<br />The study found that one&rsquo;s growing familiarity with the use of a specific technology could affect an educator&rsquo;s self-assessed TPACK score. Once an educator understood how to use a specific technology its familiarity made it transparent or simply just another piece of the curriculum. The study also found that barriers can have a significant effect on an educators&rsquo; decision making when deciding to use technology, and as a result affects an educator&rsquo;s self-assessed TPACK score.<br />Recommendations for further study include examining how the familiarity or transparent nature of technology can affect curricular decision-making, future professional development regarding the TPACK framework, and educator beliefs or efficacy as it relates to integrating technology.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multiple case study investigates English language (EL) teacher educators&rsquo; cognitions and practices related to pedagogical technology integration. The focus concerns five native-English speaking teacher educators (TEs) within a teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) training program at a South Korean university. The goal was to determine 1) TESOL-TEs&rsquo; cognitions regarding the pedagogical purposes and efficacies of 21st&ndash;century digital technologies, 2) TESOL-TEs&rsquo; uses of such technologies in their practice, and 3) factors related to TESOL-TEs&rsquo; decisions of whether and how to integrate technologies into their praxis. Data collected over twenty weeks in 2013 included four rounds of semi-structured interviews and two sets of classroom observations for each of the five focal participants, interviews with program administrators, written reflections, field notes, photographs, and document review. Data were coded using King&rsquo;s (2004) template analysis method. Categories were based on constructs from the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra and Koehler, 2006) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et al., 2003) and UTAUT 2 (Venkatesh et al., 2012). The focal participants displayed high levels of TPACK and used Web 2.0 applications extensively to facilitate interactions in their roles as teacher educators. It was found that UTAUT factors guided TEs&rsquo; decisions and use behaviour to varying degrees, but that the mediating factor of age did not relate to TEs&rsquo; decisions in the manner predicted by the UTAUT. TEs&rsquo; cognitions both coincided with and diverged from their practices. This study contributes to research gaps on the roles, cognitions, and technology-related practices of TESOL-TEs in South Korea. Research on TEs in different contexts is recommended to gain further insights into the connections among these factors. TESOL program administrators and TEs will particularly benefit from the light shed on teacher educator cognitions and practices in this study.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Sociological and cultural analysts have noted the reticence of public secondary schooling to recognize and build academic activities around the participatory culture in which adolescents are so readily involved (Jenkins, Purushotma, Weigel, Clinton &amp; Robison, 2009). Despite the Common Core State Standards having required students to demonstrate they can maximize technology to perform a range of skills involving targeted specialized research, organized writing, and visually intentional presentation (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices [NGA], Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSSO], 2010), very few classrooms have followed through. The avoidance and or failure of these educational technology integrations in secondary subject content classes raised questions. A survey of the literature showcases the many ways in which technologies were not fully matched to the tasks, expectations, or teacher skills. The mystery of epic technological classroom can be resolved if we apply the lens of Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (Shulman, 1986; Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) which speaks about the interactions and alignment tensions among these three areas. When one has applied this TPACK lens we can best understand a range of surveyed literature that speaks to disconnect among technology affordances, teacher pedagogies, and requirements of content knowledge. Among a range of TPACK research emerges a sub-set that advocates for the value of cognitive scaffolding through hard scaffolds and soft scaffolds (Saye &amp; Brush, 2002). Previous research has suggested the hard scaffolds can offer a built pedagogy filled with student project expectations and that soft scaffolds can provide specific practices support that is customized and relevant for participants. This research study engages in design-based research to refine hard and soft scaffolds to support high school social studies students through a multi-phase oral history project. Engaging 2 sections of students at a progressive public high school, the researcher engaged in a two-iteration cycle of design activities between November 2014 and March 2015. A student work digital portfolio was turned in after students used the first iteration scaffolds. After a teacher-provided analysis of student work using the researchers provided rubric, tweaks were made to the scaffolds. A post-interview with participant teachers provided further refinement.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;According to Molnar (2014), full time virtual school education lacks a measurement tool that accurately measures effective virtual teacher practice. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, the current study sought to understand the common practices among full time K-8 virtual school teachers, the extent to which teachers believed such practices impacted student learning, as well as the methods in which current standards, recommendations and practices were implemented in the full time K-8 virtual school setting. The relationship between virtual school teacher practices and their Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) was also explored. Using the standards, practices and recommendations developed for online learning from International Association for K&ndash;12 Online Learning (iNACOL), National Education Association (NEA), Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) a team of focus group members gave input on the common practices for teaching students in the full time K-8 virtual school environment. The results included 11 general virtual school teacher practices, 12 teacher practices relating to evaluation and three practices relating to special needs and diverse learners. Qualitative and quantitative findings indicated that teachers most frequently meet the established practices through the following strategies: phone conferences, live sessions with students, feedback on assessments, webmail communication, professional development, collaborating with peers/teacher collaboration, professional learning communities, curriculum based assessments on the phone, communicating with family stakeholders, and determining students in the bottom quartile. A framework for K-8 full time virtual school pedagogy which includes evaluating student learning and individualizing instruction through technology tools and collaborative methods was developed.</p>
<p>Finally, the quantitative findings indicated that of the three virtual school teacher practice categories (teacher practice, evaluation and special needs and diverse learners), evaluation was the leading predictor of teacher TPACK scores. Specifically, collaboration, having an online voice and presence, and using data from assessments to modify instruction were found to significantly predict a teacher&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge. Using virtual school teachers&rsquo; expertise on the practices which most impact student learning and the methods for implementing virtual school teacher practices, the researcher created a draft full time K-8 virtual school teacher evaluation rubric.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teachers&rsquo; information and communication technology (ICT) competences are a key variable to integrate such resources into the teaching-learning process. While the TPACK framework has been employed in many studies associated with use of technology in the classrooms, reports on the pre-service teachers&rsquo; development of TPACK-Math are inadequate to provide comprehensive quote. With the aim to investigate the changes in pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; perceptions regarding the use of technology subsequent to their university training in mathematics teaching, this study employed cluster analysis to categorize teachers into groups based on their self-reported TPACK-Math profiles. The study also employed the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to check and identify the TPACK-Math profile differences of the pre-service primary teachers based on their year of study and multiple regression analysis to find out which of the TPACK-Math domains had a significant influence on pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards integration of ICT in mathematics instruction. For this purpose, quantitative data analysis had been made with data from a single survey design study on pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward integration of ICT in instruction that collected information from a sample of 166 male and female pre-service primary teachers. Cluster analysis revealed three categories of pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK-Math profiles. ANOVA revealed significant TPACK-Math profile differences of the pre-service primary teachers based on their year of study and multiple regression analysis revealed that contextual knowledge and technological knowledge have the most significant influence on preservice primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward integration of ICT in instruction for this sample.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The increase in mobile technology options for students in post-secondary, continuing education influences how instructors design and implement courses, specifically online courses (S&ouml;zc&uuml;, İpek, &amp; Kinay, 2016). Much of the current research addresses technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPaCK), course design, and/or mobile technology as separate topics. There is limited research addressing the combination of TPaCK, design, and mobile technology from the course instructors&rsquo; perspective. The mixed methods study addressed design for online, mobile learning with a new layer of the TPaCK instructional framework in three phases.</p>
<p>Phase 1 involved a pilot study of a survey that measured TPaCK, lesson design practices, and design perceptions. The pilot study responses informed Phase 2. In Phase 2, the survey was given to 33 current online course facilitators from PBS TeacherLine, an online continuing education course provider. Responses were gathered. In Phase 3, a qualitative interview designed to understand online course instructors&rsquo; perceptions of their use of mobile technology, design decisions, and the TPaCK, instructional framework was conducted with a random sample of twelve people from the survey participant pool. The threefold data collection process allowed for a triangulation of the findings, which heightened construct validity and comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p>In Finding 1, 100% of the online continuing education course facilitators integrated TPaCK in their courses through the use of mobile and digital tools. In Finding 2, 100% of the online continuing education course facilitators made dynamic and innovative mobile and digital design decisions through the creation of supplemental course content. In Finding 3, 92% of online continuing education course facilitators utilized mobile technology in their online courses through an innovative inclusion of both mobile devices and mobile apps. Five conclusions resulted from the study and are discussed. The study contributes to existing literature by [sic]&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This dissertation investigates whether preservice teachers majoring in elementary education, in the context of a teacher preparation program at a higher education institution, develop technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) with the goal of having the capacity to successfully integrate technology while planning instruction and teaching in PreK-6 classrooms. The dissertation is presented in a non-traditional format including an introduction, three manuscripts prepared for journal publication, and a concluding chapter.</p>
<p>The three journal articles tapped into the essential components surrounding the dissertation&rsquo;s focus of preK-6 preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK development during their teacher preparation program. The first article provided an extensive literature review examining the development of TPACK framework with a specific focus on assessing preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK development via five different research methods (self-report, open-ended questionnaire, performance assessment, interview, and observation). The second article actively explored preK-6 preservice teachers&rsquo; development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) through triangulated assessments after completing a series of required content methodology courses. The third article utilized case study approach to investigate how prepared a preservice teacher is to use technology within literacy content instruction during a practicum experience.</p>
<p>The three articles provided an analysis of the relevant literature and thoroughly explored the research questions that were posed. A thorough data analysis provided evidence regarding the impact of teacher preparation program experience on preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK development. In general, main conclusions can be drawn from this study. These include the following: technology integration modeling or scaffolding from teacher preparation program instructors and field instructors can enhance preservice teachers&rsquo; overall TPACK development, the need of continuing longitudinal study to keep track of preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK development during teacher preparation program, and close relationship of pedagogical-related knowledge development and methodology courses. Method courses provide the opportunity for preservice teachers to learn more about content-specific pedagogical approaches and teach in real classrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Current literature showed there is a need to help faculty improve their iPad integration practices. Using a sequential mixed-methods design, the researcher explored the relationship among faculty&rsquo;s iPad integration levels, their teachers&rsquo; knowledge (TPACK), and pedagogy among faculty members who had integrated iPads into their teaching for at least two semesters. The data were collected with a cross-section questionnaire, follow-up interviews and artifacts. Responses were collected respectively with the three sections of the questionnaire: iPad Usage (N=160), TPACK (N=151), and demographics (N=147). Eight participants were interviewed after the survey. The results indicated TPACK and learning-centered pedagogy were necessary but insufficient conditions for the transformation levels of iPad integration. Technology itself might not bring a pedagogical shift. Learning to teach with technology could be a catalyst that triggers changes in teaching practices. However, the teacher must act as the agent for these changes. The results of this study could be informative to faculty who hope to improve their own iPad integration levels, or faculty developers and administrators to determine more effective ways to support iPad integration in their institutions.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The development of high quality online teachers within a Florida school district is critical given the exponential growth of virtual district programs, the lack of experienced online teachers, and the lack of infrastructure to develop online teachers transitioning from brick and mortar settings. The skills required for teaching in an online setting is significantly different than teaching in a physical classroom due to the fact that students are separated by time and space (Storandt, Dossin, &amp; Lacher, 2012). Online teachers need to understand how to facilitate teaching and learning through the use of technology to engage and motivate learners that are separated by time and space.</p>
<p>My research examined the perspectives of six successful online teachers from a Florida district virtual instruction program about their development in becoming online teachers. The research questions guiding this study were: What professional learning experiences shaped the development of successful online instructors within a district virtual instruction program? What supports and professional learning experiences do successful online instructors within a district virtual instruction program believe that future novice online teachers need?</p>
<p>In this qualitative research study I conducted three semi-structured interviews with each of six successful virtual teachers. The term successful was defined in this context as high percentage of completion rates and highly effective rating on the teacher evaluation system. The participants articulated the importance of both the type professional learning and the content for improving their online practices. Participants&rsquo; recommendations for professional learning for novice online teachers differed slightly, but had the same large categories of online technology, online pedagogy, and online content knowledge, which align with Mirsha and Koehler&rsquo;s (2006) Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) framework. Their insights will assist with understanding the needs of novice virtual teachers as they transition from a brick and mortar setting.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This study examined the processes used by literacy teachers when planning to integrate technology into their instruction and the usefulness of the Technology Integration Planning Cycle (TIPC; Hutchison &amp; Woodward, 2014a) for framing teachers&rsquo; planning processes. Three participants from a larger technology integration project completed a think-aloud session as they planned an upcoming literacy lesson in which they anticipated using technology. This study was designed as a think-aloud study (Pressley &amp; Afflerbach, 1995; Cho &amp; Woodward, 2014) with extensive complementary data (Cho, 2014; Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007; Zhang &amp; Duke, 2011). In addition to concurrent and retrospective verbal protocols, data sources included: interviews, surveys and questionnaires, observations, and documents and photos. Analysis of data collected from these sources was conducted in two cycles, open-ended coding (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008) then hypothesis coding (Salda&ntilde;a, 2016). Findings indicated that participants utilized pedagogical content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge in different ways when planning. Notably, misunderstandings about content knowledge may be somewhat accommodated by integrating technology into literacy instruction. Further, teachers each had different stances towards integrating technology that influenced their planned instruction. Finally, while most elements of the TIPC were found in the participants&rsquo; planning, teachers varied in their ability to focus on the instructional goal. Conceptual, methodological, and instructional implications are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xiong, X. (2015). Developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in educatio competencies in a Chinese normal university: The role of curriculum leaders (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 3734720)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at higher education in China, in addition to the political control of the central government, the top-down curriculum management system of the universities seems to support the effectiveness of teacher education programmes. Thus, the demand for information and communications technology (ICT) in teacher education not only affects the context and structure of teacher education programmes, but also challenges the role of curriculum leaders. As the core of all other leadership activities (Wiles, 2009), curriculum leadership is responsible for both the maintenance and improvement of teacher education programmes. Furthermore, in creating a meaningful learning context, it is vital for pre-service teachers to develop ICT in education competencies. Therefore, there are research gaps in the investigation of how curriculum leadership supports or hinders teacher education programmes in the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. This study is intended to fill in the research gaps. It poses the following guiding questions to explore the theme in greater depth. First, how do teacher education programmes affect the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies? Second, how does curriculum leadership shape teacher education programmes, and how do those programmes shape it in turn? Third, what are the roles of curriculum leaders in developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies?</p>
<p>This study was conducted at Guangxi Normal University (GXNU), a provincial normal university in mainland China. Based on the theoretical and contextual background, its conceptual framework was contextualised in three top-down layers of administration, including the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Guangxi Provincial Department of Education and GXNU. The curriculum leaders at the university, subordinate school and classroom levels constitute the curriculum leadership system at GXNU. They play interactive roles in programme planning, implementation and evaluation to develop pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. This framework provided a general guide for the tools and parameters required for data collection and analysis in this study.</p>
<p>According to the research questions, this study adopted a mixed-methods research approach, sequentially integrating a quantitative survey with qualitative interviews and documentation analysis. As pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-assessed perceptions of TPACK were likely to predict their ICT in education competencies, 211 pre-service teachers in the three programmes were surveyed to examine their TPACK perceptions. Valid data were analysed via statistical methods in SPSS 17.0. The interviewees included 13 curriculum leaders at the university, subordinate school and classroom levels, respectively, and 12 pre-service teachers were selected for focus group interviews. The qualitative data were analysed via open and axial coding. The findings from both methods were compared and combined.</p>
<p>The integrated findings clarify the role of curriculum leaders in developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. Curriculum leaders at the university level (e.g., the Vice-President (Academic)) provide support in the forms of policy formulation and resource allocation. Curriculum leaders at the subordinate school level (e.g., the Vice-Dean (Academic)) have a significant effect on the application of ICT to education curriculum structures, course objectives and academic credit management. Furthermore, curriculum leaders at the classroom level (e.g., course coordinators or lecturers) have a significant effect on course content and pedagogy.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the interactions between curriculum leadership and teacher education programmes. Curriculum leadership shapes teacher education programmes by providing supportive policies, planning or managing curricula and evaluating pre-service teachers&rsquo; learning outcomes. The programmes may also shape the practices of curriculum leaders in terms of the changing educational system requirements and current curricula constraints. This finding may help to provide empirical evidence and achieve an understanding of the effectiveness of teacher education programmes.</p>
<p>This study also reveals that curriculum leaders are under pressure to acquire and use effective programme management strategies related to the use of ICT in education. In particular, this study highlights the importance of university senior management in supporting coordination and communication between curriculum leaders. This study also explains that pre-service teachers&rsquo; teaching reflections and evaluations are of great importance for improving courses or programmes and informing the practices of curriculum leaders.</p>
<p>Beyond these findings, this study contributes to an important future direction for TPACK. It suggests that examining TPACK at the programme and course levels with a focus on curriculum leadership requires more research. The outcomes of the study are expected to expand the theoretical knowledge of curriculum leadership effects, especially in relation to the use of ICT in teacher education. The findings imply the need for consistent support, collaboration and commitment to programme improvement from all educational stakeholders.</p>
<p>Finally, the limitations of the study are highlighted, including its generalisation and methodological limitations and its small sample of interviewed curriculum leaders and surveyed pre-service teachers. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The relationship between the use of Geogebra and Technological Pedagogical Content and Knowledge (TPACK) by teachers has not been fully investigated and understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to integrate GeoGebra technology to develop the TPACK of secondary school pre-service mathematics teachers. The participants of this study were 60 Indian teachers. Data were collected through the administration of pre-post TPACK surveys using a Google Online survey. Results from the survey revealed that there were changes in teachers&rsquo; TPACK after undergoing the Geogebra workshop. Practical implications are discussed regarding how to enhance pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK using GeoGebra in mathematics teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework used in the pre-service teacher training program requires new approaches to the effective integration of technology in science education, highlighting the intersection of the three main domains previously mentioned (technology, pedagogy and science content knowledge) in the training of prospective teachers. To develop the pre-service teacher&rsquo;s confidence in using TPACK we have chosen training activities built on web-based comics and mind/concept maps as our pedagogical methods. Web-based comics consist of fixed sequences of images and text created and viewed through dedicated online applications. In science education, comics represent a creative alternative to present and explain a concept, phenomenon and/or a situation. Visual methods such as concept cartoons or concept maps can be used for learning new concepts or systemizing information. We have opted for these methods since communicating scientific concepts and knowledge through visual representations and using web 2.0 applications and gadgets are feature which characterize the current generation of students. In this paper we describe the way in which pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the Teacher Training Program at the West University of Timisoar between the years 2014 and 2016, have acquired and evaluated TPACK while participating in the design, management and analysis of learning activities based on visual representations developed for compulsory education. Our study reveals that they consider the integration of web based comics in their teaching activities to be beneficial for presenting, explaining and assessing the concepts and phenomena taught in class, as well as for identifying and correcting misconceptions. Furthermore, our study shows that the future physics teachers have developed TPACK since an efficient integration of comics and mind maps assumes a more profound understanding of the relationship between technology, pedagogical knowledge and the scientific content taught in class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this research was to determine how use of the Technology Integration Matrix (TIM) influenced preservice educators&rsquo; metacognition about technology integration into teaching and learning practices. The TIM addressed preservice educators&rsquo; needs to develop awareness of, and abilities to, apply the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Teachers and Students (ISTE, 2015). The TIM assisted preservice educators in connecting the ISTE standards to content standards and theories of teaching and learning by developing effective lessons. Through completion of TIMs, preservice educators not only connected ISTE standards and content standards, but also visualized the relationships to pedagogical models and theories. Findings from this study included an increase in preservice educators&rsquo; awareness of today&rsquo;s learners, ISTE standards, connections to pedagogy, and increased abilities to transform learning experiences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adam, A. (2017). A framework for seeking the connections between technology, pedagogy, and culture: A study in the Maldives. Journal of Open, Flexible and Distance Learning, 21(1), 35-51. Retrieved from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318119664</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Educational technology researchers have often overlooked the effect of culture on teachers&rsquo; use of digital technologies in their pedagogical practice. Several technology integration models, such as the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK), have also failed to explain the connections between technology, pedagogy, and culture. This paper argues that teachers&rsquo; pedagogical and technological practices cannot be fully understood without considering the social and cultural norms of their specific cultures. An ethnographic methodology, linked to Bourdieu&rsquo;s (1977) habitus, is used to explore teacher educators&rsquo; practices in the Maldives. The author uses interviews, observations, focus groups, and the hanging-out approach to gather data from eleven teacher educators who work in a Maldivian university. Key findings demonstrate that teacher educators&rsquo; pedagogical and technological practices are influenced by their own culture, their early learning experiences in the Maldives, and their workplace (institutional context). Through this finding, the paper proposes a framework; namely, Pedagogical and Technological Cultural Habitus (PATCH), for understanding teachers&rsquo; pedagogical and technological habitus in various contexts. The PATCH framework provides a theoretical basis for designing technology-oriented professional development for professionals in various pedagogical contexts, including virtual and blended pedagogical spaces. It also contributes to the TPACK framework by adding an outer layer to its current theorisation to represent teachers&rsquo; backgrounds and habitus when examining their practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological resources offer indisputable opportunities to teachers who want to renew the contents and strategies of their teaching and provide students&rsquo; active learning processes. An example for everyone is the thematic repository of digital educational content that can be used with active methodologies such as flipped classroom and inquiry-based learning (Bergmann &amp; Sams, 2012; Strayer, 2012; Huang &amp; Chiu, 2015). As suggested by the descriptive model of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge &ndash; TPCK (Harris, Mishra, &amp; Koehler, 2009; Koehler, Mishra, &amp; Yahya, 2007), all this requires the teacher to rethink the relationship with his knowledge and students themselves (Charlot, 1997, Vincent &amp; Carnus, 2015) as well as a new type of knowledge that specifically deals with the choice and use of digital content, their re-elaboration and protection from the legal point of view. The contribution, retrieving the reflections from the TPCK model, calls for a discus- sion on the type of technological knowledge required today to the teacher for a &lsquo;wise use&rsquo; (Jenkins, 2010, Ri- voltella, 2013) &ndash; but also an effective and &lsquo;legal&rsquo; &ndash; of digital resources. Through a case study &ndash; based on the analysis of a thematic repository in use in a High School of Bari province &ndash; will be highlighted, in their didactic implications, aspects such as the computer security, the intellectual property of digital resources by teachers and by others, the access/use by students.&rdquo;<br />Agustin, R.R., &amp; Lilisari, L.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to capture pre-service science teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) that is demonstrated during preliminary practical context in term of peer teaching program- a course conducted prior to teaching practice. Ten pre-service science teachers were involved in a semester long peer teaching program. Descriptive method was employed with the use of teaching artifacts, observation and self-reported survey for representing the way the participant integrate technology into their teaching. TPACK constructs were defined using relevant literature as frameworks. This study found that TPACK of pre-service science teachers were still low and is not sufficient for teaching science in junior high school. Furthermore, it is needed several supporting program to prepare pre-service science teachers&rsquo; competencies in teaching science with technology. In this case, more sophisticated peer teaching program with better purchase is necessity to improve TPACK competencies of pre-service science teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The call to reform education systems is being heard in many countries around the world. The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a framework that captures some of the essential qualities of the knowledge required by teachers for effective pedagogical practice in a technology-enhanced educational environment using technology and pedagogy content knowledge (TPACK). A TPACK Short and Quick (TPACK-SQ) survey questionnaire was used to explore and assess 244 in- and pre-service science and mathematics teachers in Kuwait. The results of the survey showed that in-service teachers needed help with some aspects of TPACK. Therefore, a workshop was developed and 57 in-service teachers were enrolled and trained based on the TPACK-SQ model. The results of posttests for their knowledge were significantly positive as against pretests. The workshop thus provides a rich example of how to support the implementation of essential elements of the TPACK-SQ model.&rdquo;<br />Baran, E., Canbazoglu Bilici, S., Albayrak Sari, A., &amp; Tondeur, J.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine preservice teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the support their teacher education programs provide for developing their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). The research was conducted with 215 preservice teachers in the last year of teacher education programs and teaching certificate programs in three universities in Turkey. Data sources were the synthesis of qualitative evidence (SQD) scale that was validated in the Turkish context as part of this study and the TPACK-practical scale. The strategies investigated in the SQD-model included: using teacher educators as role models; reflecting on the role of technology in education; learning how to use technology by design; collaboration with peers; scaffolding authentic technology experiences; and providing continuous feedback. The linear regression analysis revealed a positive relation between teacher education strategies and preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK. Reflection and teacher educators&rsquo; as role models were the most frequently used teacher education strategies in teacher education programs included in this study. Results provided recommendations for further research on the connection between the teacher education strategies and the development of preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK in teacher education programs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;A national symposium on the role of efficacy research in the development, adoption, and implementation of educational technology will take place in 2017. The Educational Technology Efficacy Research symposium represents the culmination of a year-long collaboration among stakeholders: academic researchers, entrepreneurs, school district and university leaders, investors, philanthropists, K-12 teachers, and college professors. This work is motivated by a belief that technology has unmet potential to improve student outcomes. The goal is to move efficacy to the center of the discourse concerning technology in education and, in doing so, create pathways for innovations that work to scale and make an impact. Ten working groups are investigating the role of efficacy research. This is a report of the initial efforts of Working Group E, which is investigating the knowledge and competence that faculty members and leaders in educational institutions need to possess with respect to learning technologies in order to prepare competent teachers and school leaders, given the expectation that technologies and societal priorities are likely to change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Although there is an established body of work arguing that teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is necessary for designing ICT-integrated lessons, little is known about the relationships among teachers&rsquo; beliefs about learning, their design dispositions, learning design practices and TPACK. Critical inquiry in this aspect is timely as a new culture of learning is emerging from the informal contexts of learning and challenging how school-based learning should be designed to foster 21st century competencies. In this study, a survey instrument was developed to assess and investigate the relationships among pre-service teachers&rsquo; beliefs about the new culture of learning and school-based learning, their design dispositions, learning design practices and relevant factors of TPACK. Based on the sample size of 223 pre-service teachers in Singapore, the validation shows that the relevant factors pertaining to TPACK, teachers&rsquo; beliefs and design were distinctive. The study shows that teachers&rsquo; beliefs about learning and their design capacities changed along with their TPACK efficacy. It also identified factors that might affect teachers&rsquo; competencies needed to design lessons that could cultivate a new 21st century culture of learning. Implications of the relationships among teachers&rsquo; beliefs about learning, their design capacities and TPACK to foster 21st century competencies are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This mixed-methods study explored the impacts of a semester-long technology professional development for secondary school international teachers from developing nations around the world. We used (a) a survey approach to examine international teachers&rsquo; perceived technology integration abilities using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework and (b) a design task to understand their rationale behind technology integration decisions. As a group (N = 16), international teachers reported increased abilities in all TPACK domains. Qualitative analysis of their rationales revealed that though teachers learned to consider the affordances of technology, technology access issues were pivotal in their choice and use of technology in instruction planning. With education becoming increasingly global, the study has implications for the motivation and design of technology professional development programs for international teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;While various quantitative measures for assessing teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) have developed rapidly, few studies to date have comprehensively validated the structure of TPACK through various criteria of validity especially for content specific areas. In this paper, we examined how the TPACK survey measure is aligned with the TPACK lesson plan measure and how they are related to the measure of epistemological beliefs about chemistry. The participants were 280 Chinese preservice chemistry teachers enrolled in a university in China. Both exploratory and confirmatory factory analyses were performed on the TPACK survey measure to help to establish validity, including considerations for convergent and discriminant validity. This was followed by the invariance test to examine factorial validity as related to gender. To establish the predictive validity of TPACK, the relationships among teachers&rsquo; epistemological beliefs, TPACK, and their capacity for planning technology-integrated lessons were also examined. Overall, the results showed that all four types of validity looked at in this study (i.e., convergent, discriminant, factorial, and predictive) were satisfactorily established. Implications for TPACK research and teacher education are also discussed.&rdquo;<br />De Rossi, M. (2017). Methodological demands, soft skill and ICT integration.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The attention for university didactics and its innovative and qualifying issues, is nowadays at the forefront of the educational discourse and strengthens more and more the opportunity to consider as linked the following complex constructs: methodological demands, ICT integration, and conjunct development of both hard skills (disciplinary) and soft skills (cross-disciplinary). This contribution wants to offer some reflections about methodologies for academic education from a learner-centred perspective considering, among the other factors, ICT usage as a crucial issue. As it is widely acknowledged, it is not enough to act on the level of instrumental equipment or isolated dimensions of teachers&rsquo; knowledge. Instead, there is the need to foster advanced models aimed at realizing ICT integration in didactics in operative and procedural ways. Moreover, these models should go beyond the link among fundamental knowledge types (disciplinary, pedagogical, technological), to consider students&rsquo; characteristics (in terms of knowledges, hard and soft skills already owned and the ones to be enhanced), and also educational context (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2009).&rdquo;</p>

The TPACK survey results and a teacher&rsquo;s VAM score were also examined, separately, with respect to teacher attributes. Upon examination of VAM scores and teacher attributes, the subject area, the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at the teacher&rsquo;s school, and the grade level of the teacher were all significantly related to VAM scores. In addition, the TPACK survey results overall and its constructs were examined with teacher attributes. The significant relationships were gender, subject area, the number of certifications, highest degree held by the teacher, years teaching, and teaching in/out of area. The analysis showed no significant relationship between a teacher&rsquo;s VAM score and the TPACK survey overall or its individual constructs.&rdquo;<br />Harris, J., &amp; Hofer, M.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2008), a theoretical construct that describes the knowledge that teachers use to teach with digital tools and resources, has flourished in university-based teacher education and research. Increasingly, K&ndash;12 schools and districts have also appropriated TPACK in their professional development efforts. This study of seven schools and districts explored how the TPACK construct was understood and used in these K&ndash;12 organizations. Study results revealed the importance of context and professional culture in appropriating the construct; the use of TPACK as a way to connect disparate professional development initiatives; TPACK conceptualized as applied knowledge; and how educational leaders&rsquo; beliefs about professional development shape how TPACK is understood and enacted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Scholarship addressing technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK or TPACK) has examined how to develop, apply, and assess it in diverse educational settings and content areas. During the last 12 years, multiple ways to understand this knowledge and support its development have emerged, generating approximately 1,200 publications that utilise the construct, impacting the practice of postsecondary faculty, administrators, and others invested in meaningful educational uses of technology. Perhaps inevitably, TPACK&rsquo;s enthusiastic reception and rapid dissemination have generated multiple points of divergence, which in turn need further study; especially the construct&rsquo;s accurate measurement and validation; how to assist preservice and in-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK development; contextual influences upon teachers&rsquo; TPACK; and the relationship of TPACK-based knowledge to teachers&rsquo; decision-making and action. Given the widespread diffusion of TPACK, research focusing on these and related issues will help to determine the direction of future post-secondary learning and teaching with technologies. Therefore, this special issue of AJET addresses future directions in TPCK/TPACK research and development.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This paper starts from the understanding that teachers&rsquo; knowledge is situated, grounded in knowledge derived from formal training and from experiences in practice. Based on this understanding we examine teachers&rsquo; reasoning in relation to the pedagogical choices teachers make while using ICT in practice. We argue that teachers&rsquo; reasoning about pedagogy elicits their technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK). Data from 29 video cases show how elementary teachers used ICT to facilitate specific pedagogical strategies (e.g., activating learning, classroom management, dealing with diversity, fostering learning strategies). Findings indicate that teachers used ICT mostly to promote activation of learning. Many teachers reasoned about using ICT for adapting their teaching to student needs, but this was seldom observed in practice. The few teachers who showed behaviour supporting adaptive teaching and fostering learning strategies almost always used ICT to facilitate these pedagogical strategies. We argue that for effective teaching with ICT it is important that teachers learn to reason explicitly about how ICT can support specific pedagogical strategies. The results from this study provide suggestions for what is needed in teacher education programs and professional development initiatives to support teachers in acquiring TPK.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Understanding how well teachers integrate digital technology in learning is the subject of considerable debate in education. High Possibility Classrooms (HPC) is a pedagogical framework drawn from research on exemplary teachers&rsquo; knowledge of technology integration in Australian school classrooms. The framework is being used to support teachers who teach various stages of schooling to take &lsquo;pedagogical steps&rsquo; in their practice with technology. This article focuses on the use of the HPC conceptual framework in a study of seven teachers and their students at two secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Analysis confirms the practicality of this conceptual framework for technology integration in secondary school classrooms. This inquiry has implications for addressing the reluctance of teachers to integrate technology in curriculum. The article concludes by suggesting that more schools might consider using conceptual frameworks like HPC to support secondary school teachers to enhance student learning with technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The main purpose of this research is to identify the competency and the perceptions of pre-service teachers on technopedagogical education. While study group of quantitative dimension is composed of 626 pre-service teachers; study group of qualitative extent is composed of 67 pre-service teachers. The sample represents 35% of the population of 1778 students. The quantitative data were collected through Technopedagogical Education Competency (Tpack-Deep) Scale and Technology Perception Scale and the qualitative data were collected with an open ended-question form. It was concluded that pre-service teachers generally regard themselves at a moderate level in the sense of technopedogogical education competency, have positive perception towards technology and there is a positive correlation between pre-service teachers&rsquo; technopedogogical educational competency and perception towards technology. According to results of qualitative analysis of the study, pre-service teachers think that educational technologies have contributions to preparing information-communication technologies based upon presentations, developing technology-based materials, preparing homework, doing research, raising awareness about the importance of educational technology use in the learning and teaching process, acquiring information about their department, developing skill of using technology based on information-communication technologies and having positive attitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology provides new methods and approaches for educational activities.<br />Therefore, teachers should improve their ability and knowledge to integrate technology into instruction. The use of technology-based learning environment which is effectively used to improve the technological pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service teachers has a crucial importance for the training of pre-service teachers. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to investigate the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), TPACK related self-confidence, and perception of pre-service middle school mathematics teachers in terms of instructional technologies. In this study, TPACK Survey, TPACK Self-Confidence<br />Survey, and TPACK Perception Survey were administered to 427 pre-service middle school mathematics teachers in elementary mathematics education program. The data were analyzed quantitatively. The data analysis revealed that there was a significant relationship between gender and perception towards technology. Moreover, it might be concluded that pre-service teachers improve their knowledge and self confidence to use technology in elementary mathematics education programs. Lastly, considering the finding that there was a relationship between the use of technology and self-confidence towards the use of technology, it might<br />be inferred that self-confidence of pre-service teachers towards the use of educational technologies increases with the use instructional tools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology is exerting a profound influence on the development of Chinese-language skills and on the education of teachers of that language around the world. This qualitative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research addressed trends and gaps in the literature related to technology and Chinese-language teacher education. The three main strands of research covered were 1) technology standards in Chinese-language teacher education, 2) the actual application of technology in such education, and 3) factors predicting Chinese-language teachers&rsquo; technology adoption. Three major findings emerged. First, technology standards need to recognize an urgent need to agree upon and teach specific sets of skills, as theorized in frameworks such as Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Second, while consistent improvements in Chinese-language teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge and technological-pedagogical knowledge have been reported, three other key components &ndash; i.e., training, practice and reflection &ndash; need to be better integrated into their teacher-training models. Third, two external factors (resources and support) and three internal factors (pedagogical beliefs, technology knowledge and demographics) emerged as crucial to technology integration among these teachers. Based on these results, this review offers a series of recommendations to practitioners, policy-makers and teacher educators.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Most countries stress that preparing quality teachers for twenty-first century students is an essential task for teacher training institutions. Besides the skills for how to teach subjects effectively, teachers should also know how to integrate digital technology into their teaching. Several studies have been done based on the TPACK framework. Some of these studies use this framework for specific subject domains. In this study a generally applicable instrument for measuring TPACK was created. The aim of the paper was to validate the created instrument and to find out how pre-service teachers perceive their technological, pedagogical and content knowledge regarding the TPACK framework in Estonia, in a technologically highly developed country where technology is broadly used in general education. Conducting factor analysis all items with technology merged into one factor meaning that young generation perceives technology already integrated with content and pedagogy. The results indicate that pre-service teachers lack pedagogical knowledge, but they perceive that they are good at integrating technology into their teaching. Differences in perceptions were also found according to gender, age and curricula.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;As technologies have become ubiquitous in society and within higher education, institutions have begun to invest in the development of faculty to leverage digital technologies during their instruction. This has been especially true in teacher education programs where standalone educational technology courses have been eliminated in favor of an infusion model where candidate TPACK development occurs throughout the entire teacher education program of study. However, faculty development experiences do not always support the development of faculty knowledge in ways that support the dynamic interactions among content, pedagogy, and technologies that is needed to effectively teach with digital tools. In response to this gap in the field, using a mixed method approach this study sought to characterize a faculty development experience grounded in both TPACK and adult learning theory that was guided by a faculty developer. Findings suggest faculty found value in the ongoing nature of the development experience, and valued faculty developer support in meeting their goals. Findings also indicated that both participating faculty and teacher education candidates enrolled in their courses both had increases in their TPACK. Implications are discussed within the context of teacher education and faculty development opportunities in higher education.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study presents the design of an educational technology course for pre-service teachers specific to incorporating computational thinking in K-8 classroom settings. Subsequently, it examines how participation in the course influences pre-service teachers&rsquo; dispositions and knowledge of computational thinking concepts and the ways in which such knowledge can be combined with content and pedagogy to promote meaningful student outcomes. Data were collected from a self-reported survey and case reports focusing on the design, implementation, and outcomes of computational thinking related lessons in K-8 classrooms. Results indicated that the course positively influenced pre-service teachers&rsquo; knowledge of computational thinking concepts, tools, and practices. Yet, some participants demonstrated only surface understanding of computational thinking and were unable to design lessons that meaningfully integrated computational thinking concepts and tools with disciplinary content and pedagogy. Findings have implications for the design of teacher education experiences that help prepare pre-service teachers develop technological pedagogical content knowledge in relation to computational thinking concepts and practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The revolutionization brought by mobile technology (m-technology) in the process of communication, interactions, access and transmission of knowledge in all endeavour of life, especially in the enterprise of science teaching cannot be ignored for its dynamic value. Science teachers&rsquo; integration of mobile technology for science teaching was investigated in Port Harcourt metropolis. A sample size of 150 science teachers (50 biology, 50 chemistry and 50 Physics teachers) used were obtained through stratified random sampling technique from 36 Secondary Schools (8 Government and 28 Private Secondary Schools) in Port-Harcourt Metropolis. Data collecting instrument was titled &ldquo;m-technology Integration Questionnaire for Science Teachers&rdquo; (MIQST) designed to diagnose science teachers m- technology devices utilization in instruction, extent of integration of in- built app, on- line science resources, on- line net-work platform and barriers to usage. The instrument was validated by experts in computer science, educational technology, science educators and test and measurement. Test- re-test was used to obtain data for the reliability and a reliability coefficient index of 0.78 was gotten using Person Product Moment Correlation statistics. Five research questions and two hypotheses which guided the study were answered and tested with percentage, mean, standard deviation (SD) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The findings reveal that out of the 150 science teachers, 141 (94.0%) of them own m- technology devices that are internet enabled while 9(6.0%) do not own m-technology internet enabled device; 48.9% of science teachers use m-technology in-built apps for teaching science; Only 10.2% science teachers use Online Science Resources (OSRs) through their m-technology device; science teachers do not effectively use online social network/media platforms through their m-technology device for science teaching [average weighted mean value = 1.44; Decision&ndash;Never used] with a retained null hypothesis at [F(2,147) = 2.996, P &lt; 0.05] and stated certain impediments towards the integration of m-technology for teaching science [aggregate weighted mean of 3.07; Decision-Accepted] with a retained null hypothesis at [F(2,147) = 2.996, P &lt; 0.05].

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) by using devices such as mobile phones is an ideal learning platform for learners to acquire language and share knowledge beyond the confines of a fixed location. By utilizing the mobile applications available via smartphone, learners can engage in collaborative networks and find information in a variety of diverse environments. This article shares the findings of a research at Mara University of Technology (UiTM) in Malaysia to determine the technological readiness of the students by measuring their digital skills using the Digital Competence Framework (EU). Some 50 students from the English language proficiency course were purposively sampled because they have been exposed to MALL by their lecturer. Their responses were collected through an online questionnaire. The findings showed that all 50 of the students owned a smartphone. While 82.6% of the students did not attend any training on how to use the smartphones, 80.4% of them have their own storing strategies and nearly 90% of them reported having technological skills in operating their smartphone such as accessing applications, ability to record, share and produce technological resources. The findings suggest that to ensure successful MALL, educators need to be aware of the background and technological skills of learners before embedding m-learning into the English Language lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;A systems approach provides insight for expanding teachers&rsquo; pedagogical reasoning for integrating multiple technologies in inquiry, communication, and collaboration. An online learning trajectory supports the integration of a systems pedagogical approach for guiding teachers in developing their technological pedagogical thinking and reasoning so they in turn are able to implement a systems pedagogical approach with their own students. Specific instructional strategies guide teachers in refining their mental models for integrating multiple technologies in teaching mathematics through their increasingly complex technological pedagogical understanding as they learn about the technologies and teaching with those technologies. This study focuses on the impact that a system of multiple technologies as pedagogical tools has on teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical reasoning as they integrate multiple technologies in their classrooms. A systems pedagogical understanding is at the core of teachers&rsquo; enhancement of their technological pedagogical reasoning, and supports the transformation of their knowledge called technological pedagogical content knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a framework for constructivist pre-service teacher training in Technology Enhanced Learning, adopting a view of teachers as designers of innovative content, working individually and/or collaboratively, discussing and interacting with the instructor, technology and their peers. In such a context, a challenging issue is the content and structure of appropriate activities for cultivating various types of synthetic knowledge combining technology, pedagogy and content through asynchronous collaboration. In this paper, we elaborate on the social orchestration of a training course around collaborative design activities and on the emerging challenges from two successive cycles of implementation. We highlight the elements used to expand and augment online interaction, drawn from two known approaches in teacher training and online learning, the TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge) framework and the CoI (Community of Inquiry) model. We specifically examine a) the impact of synthetic design activities to the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; synthetic knowledge (of Technology, Pedagogy and Content) and b) the relationships among specific elements of TPACK and CoI. Findings drawn from the examination of pre-service teachers&rsquo; perspectives through two structured questionnaires reveal important potential of synthetic activities for teachers&rsquo; TPACK development and highlight specific connections among elements of the TPACK and CoI frameworks.</p>

Australasia Journal of Educational Technology, 33(3), 32-45. doi:10.14742/ajet.3498<br />Abstract: &ldquo;A primary concern of teacher technology education is for pre-service teachers to develop a sophisticated mental model of the affordances of technology that facilitates both teaching and learning with technology. One of the main obstacles to developing the requisite technological pedagogical content knowledge is the inherent challenge faced by teachers in monitoring and controlling certain aspects of their own learning while navigating the web and designing a lesson plan. This paper reviews preliminary findings obtained in our research with nBrowser, an intelligent web browser designed to support pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-regulated learning and acquisition of technological pedagogical content knowledge. Case examples of data mining techniques are presented that allow the discovery of knowledge regarding pre-service teachers&rsquo; information-seeking and acquisition behaviours and how to support them. The first case illustrates the use of simulated learner experiments, while the second involves the creation of a model to detect learner behaviours. We discuss the implications in terms of design guidelines recommendations for nBrowser as well as the broader impacts for future research on technological pedagogical content knowledge research and development.&rdquo;<br />Reinsfield, E., &amp; Williams, P.J.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology education in the New Zealand context has seen significant change since it&rsquo;s inception as a technical subject. The changing nature of the subject in New Zealand secondary schools is influenced by some teachers&rsquo; preoccupation with the making of quality product outcomes, rather than their enactment of the curriculum, which conceptualises a wider remit. Research into the perceptions of technology teachers&rsquo; interpretation and enactment of the curriculum suggests that to enable change, teachers need to adopt a form of &ldquo;technological thinking&rdquo;, in support of their &ldquo;technical thinking&rdquo;. Technological thinking is a notion presented to support teachers to explore a range of differing pedagogical approaches and learning outcomes, reflective of the intent of the New Zealand curriculum, which aims to foster learning environments that are innovative and responsive to students&rsquo; social and academic needs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Three distinct clusters were identified from a survey study of a sample of 127 unit coordinators from a regional Australian University. The clusters emerged after a survey that explored perceptions of pedagogical practices that incorporated the use of Information Communication and Technology (ICT). The key components of the survey were based on seven constructs derived from the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). For future investigations of TPACK application in university contexts, a three-cluster configuration of teacher-practitioners is proposed that requires empirical confirmation. Alongside the theorised clusters of university lecturers according to their perceived engagement with ICT, several layers of technology policy disconnect have also been discovered. The relevance of the findings of the inquiry and their implications on universities that conduct ICT intensive courses are also discussed, especially in relation to improving teaching practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examines the impact of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in-house professional development trainings based on Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge in-Action (TPACK-In-Action) model on female teachers&rsquo; pedagogy at a Saudi Arabian university. Data were collected using survey questionnaires to gather participants&rsquo; pre-workshops and post-workshops responses followed by semi-structured interviews to understand aspects that determined the effect of the training workshops on teachers&rsquo; pedagogy. The findings show that despite having sound pedagogy and teaching qualifications, participants could not successfully utilize their skills to incorporate technology effectively in their teaching. Institutional policies regarding technology integration and complex pacing guide which directed learning objectives and course materials could not give teachers the freedom to integrate learned skills in class, thus, the trainings provided to them became ineffective. The findings of the study suggest arranging training workshops according to the needs of the teachers who want to integrate technology in teaching. The study also recommends that an informed institutional policy regarding the use of technology is important which will ultimately result in effectiveness of the training workshops. Such decisions should be taken in accordance with the teaching syllabus and its pacing guide, and technology integration should be prescribed as a part of syllabus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework considers the role of technology in teaching. Although TPACK is grounded in context, one limitation is the lack of understanding about the interactions between particular contexts, knowledge development, and instruction. This qualitative multiple-case study was designed to explore the contextual factors that contribute to teachers&rsquo; development of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge and practice. Researchers focused on the Catholic educational environment to develop a more refined understanding of specific, and unique, contextual factors within the TPACK framework. Individual case analysis of interview and observation data pointed toward microlevel, or teacher-centric, factors, including background, attitudes, and personal conceptualization of contemporary education, to be primary influences of the development and use of technological knowledge. Recommendations are made for educators to think about how changes in context influence the distinct overlapping components of the TPACK framework, and accordingly their individual TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study is to explore the issues and challenges in integrating technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for computer programming courses. This study employed the triangulation method of the case studies and Grounded Theory (GT). Twenty-five computer programming educators were interviewed via online such as e-mail, media social&rsquo;s chatting and messaging application like WhatsApp and Telegram. The main issue discovered in this study is the misconception in using technology for teaching and learning computer programming. Besides that, there were two major challenges found in this study. The challenges are the instructors were not able to explore the rapid development of technology and this may cause the lack of technological pedagogical knowledge among them. They also showed the lack of knowledge about pedagogy and assessment for teaching and learning computer programming that relevant to the programming content. The research that has been done showed that TPACK model is very suitable to guide exploration about how educators make use of technology appropriate to the pedagogy and content. However, the exploration that has been done has limitation on how educators integrate student&rsquo;s assessment on affective and instructional design implementation with TPACK. Therefore, this paper suggesting for the future study, in order that more exploration should be doing about how assessment on student&rsquo;s affective and instructional design would be integrate with technology, pedagogy and content knowledge via TPACK model.&rdquo;</p>

International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning, 12(7), 124-135. doi:10.3991/ijet.v12i07.7223</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;As a new types of educational knowledge integration framework under the appeal for informatization, Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) has become a prerequisite for teachers to integrate technologies into their teaching effectively. A comprehensive analysis of the current challenges faced by practical curriculums on economic management is presented in this paper. A curriculum design model was constructed based on the TPACK theoretic framework and the constructivism learning theory. The curriculum &lsquo;Enterprise Operation and Decision Simulation System&rsquo; was taken as an example, and the practical curriculum system for economic management under the TPACK framework was designed from three aspects, namely, teaching content, teaching methodology, and teaching technique. On this basis, an econometric analysis software was used to analyze the effects of curriculum implementation. Research indicates that TPACK plays a significant role in improving teaching quality, elevating student satisfaction, and cultivating students&rsquo; professional application and practice abilities. The research conclusion is of certain reference value to the practical teaching reform and development in universities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study aims to identify profiles of pre-service teachers in order to explore their readiness to integrate technology in education. The assumption is that pre-service teacher characteristics such as technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), go together with the influence of their teacher training. Specifically, this study examines whether pre-service teachers can be clustered on the basis of their TPACK, a typical set of ICT-related characteristics (e.g., general ICT attitudes, attitudes towards ICT in education, ease of use, ICT self-efficacy), and the perceived support at their training institution to adequately integrate ICT in education. Data were collected from a sample of 688 last-year pre-service teachers in 18 teacher training institutions in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). Using correlational and latent profile analysis, the results suggest that: (1) two profiles can be distinguished, (2) TPACK and other individual ICT-related characteristics are positively correlated, and (3) pre-service teachers in a profile with strong TPACK, attitudes, and self-efficacy scores also report high scores on the support they perceive at their teacher training institution. Implications for the role of teacher training institutions are discussed with a specific focus on how to close the gap between the two identified profiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Many teacher education institutes (TEI) are expected to provide preservice teachers (PTs) with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to teach with information and communication technology (ICT). To address this challenge, many TEIs have included introductory ICT courses in their curriculum to develop technological knowledge and skills. Although several existing studies have focused on detecting whether a course or a short-term training program can make an improvement on PTs&rsquo; TPACK, none of the existing studies have attempted to investigate in a longitudinal process whether PTs&rsquo; perceived development of TPACK skills follow an increasing linear pattern through years as planned in four-year-long teacher education programs, especially in ELT. This study therefore intends to address this gap in the literature. Based on TPACK survey with open-ended questions, results of the study indicated a nonlinear pattern of TPACK development over time. In line with these findings, suggestions for teacher educators, policy-makers, and future research were made.&rdquo;</p>

Following a series of classroom observations and interviews, inductive qualitative analyses of data indicated that teachers felt that technology supported students&rsquo; mathematics learning and prepared them for their future where technology was important. However, observations indicated that despite teaching in one-to-one environments, students only used technology on rare occasions or if they finished activities early. Further, these technology-based activities were low-level review of mathematics computations. Implications include the need to provide effective support to teachers about integrating technology in meaningful ways.<br />Design/methodology/approach<br />This study involved classroom observations of two third grade teachers.<br />Findings<br />Findings indicate that teachers used Chrome books in one-to-one classrooms to provide students with extra practice on computational skills.<br />Research limitations/implications<br />There is a need for future studies to look at teachers&rsquo; use of technology and its influence on student learning.<br />Practical implications<br />Teacher education programs and school leaders should provide opportunities for current and future teachers to learn about technology with content specific examples.<br />Originality/value<br />This study provided an examination of all of the third grade teachers in a school who all were teaching mathematics in one-to-one classroom environments.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Twenty-first century skills have attracted significant attention in recent years. Student of today and the future are expected to have the skills necessary for collaborating, problem solving, creative and innovative thinking, and the ability to take advantage of information and communication technology (ICT) applications. Teachers must be familiar with various pedagogical approaches and the appropriate ways to use ICT to support the development of their students&rsquo; twenty-first century skills. The technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework provides a theoretical model for studying the ways in which teachers use ICT in education. Still, the TPACK framework faces certain difficulties, especially concerning the instruments currently used for studying TPACK. These challenges are primarily related to the psychometric properties of the instruments and areas of pedagogical knowledge. Within this paper we introduce a new TPACK questionnaire, the TPACK-21 questionnaire which is grounded on twenty-first century skills. The TPACK-21 questionnaire is validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results provide a six factor CFA model aligning with the TPACK theoretical framework. Also, the associations among TPACK sub-constructs, and the weak and strong areas of pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK will be discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) has been introduced as a conceptual framework for the knowledge domains teachers need to master to teach successfully using technology, and has drawn much attention across the educational field. Yet, the framework has been criticized for not being practically useful, due to inaccurate and insufficient definitions. To better understand the critics and the usefulness of the framework, an investigation of how the framework has been applied to show teacher TPACK is needed. This study is a systematic literature review of 107 peer-reviewed journal articles concerning the use of TPACK in empirical studies published from 2011 to 2016. The study supplements previous review studies with more recent work on general characteristics of TPACK studies as well as contributes an analysis of how the framework has been applied to identify teacher TPACK in recent literature. Findings show a variety of approaches and instruments to examine teacher TPACK. Most common is to identify teacher TPACK via self-reporting, while performance evaluations of teaching activities are rare. Additionally, the ways TPACK is operationalized as a measuring instrument are often implicit and make comparison of results difficult. Future directions for research are discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is seen that students face certain difficulties when learning the concepts and the relationships between them in the mathematics education that aims at enabling students to learn on the highest level. Identifying and eliminating these difficulties, helping students in the learning process and guiding them are among teachers&rsquo; tasks. Overcoming the difficulties experienced by students is considered one of the contributions of the technological use to the mathematics education. Yet, the efficient use of information and communication technologies in overcoming student difficulties is possible through bringing teachers and pre-service teachers in basic knowledge and skills. To this end, the effectiveness of the instruction in which pre-service teachers benefit from information and communication technologies to overcome the difficulties regarding a given concept was investigated. The participants were 32 third-year pre-service teachers attending at the elementary mathematics education of a state university. The effectiveness of pre-service teachers&rsquo; micro-instructions and their opinions on the role and effect of technology in their instructions were analyzed within the framework of specified themes. The instructional plans, observation sheets, self-evaluations, and the inventory of the interviews performed in regard to self-evaluations which affected the change in the process were analyzed with the content analysis. Consequently, the findings obtained in the study showed how the pre-service teachers performed effective instructions and revealed the positive change in their perspectives, possible means that technologies can offer to students in the mathematics education, and their positive contributions to their own learning. As for the components and recommendations of this pre-service educational program, it will be effective in the planning of instructional process in future studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Microteaching is regarded as an effective method that allows preservice teachers to gain the experience of instructional processes and is used to improve teaching skills in an environment similar to a real classroom. Microteaching, which is utilized as a method for increasing the quality of a teacher&rsquo;s education, is also used in research studies conducted within the scope of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK). Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to observe changes in preservice teachers&rsquo; TPCK from their microteaching practices conducted under a conceptual TPCK framework. The participants are 52 third-year preservice teachers. An analysis was performed based on specific themes from the application, which had been developed to reveal the changes in preservice teachers&rsquo; conceptual framework of TPCK components. Content analysis was used to analyze the observation forms, self-evaluations, and transcriptions from the interviews on the self-evaluations for the effects over their procedural changes within the context of the themes. The study&rsquo;s findings indicate that preservice teachers use the technological tools to attain what they had specified in their instructional plans. Also when considered in terms of the TPCK components, preservice teachers made remarkable progress.&rdquo;<br />Yorulmaz, A., Can, S., &amp; Cokcaliskan, H. (2017).

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of the current study is to determine the relationship between the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; epistemological beliefs and techno pedagogical subject-area competencies. While the universe of the study is comprised of a total of 187 senior pre-service teachers attending the Department of Classroom Teacher Education in Mugla Sıtkı Kocman University in 2014-2015 academic year, the sampling consists of 141 pre-service teachers selected through the random sampling method from among the universe. The reason for selecting the senior students for the universe of the study was that they had already taken the subject-area, pedagogical and general culture courses. In the collection of the research data, The Techno Pedagogical Competency Scale and Epistemological Belief Scale and a personal information form were used. The data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS 21.0 program package. During the analysis process, first it was tested whether the data display a normal distribution and after it was determined that the data show a normal distribution, from among the descriptive statistics, t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to reveal the differences and Pearson-product Moment Correlation Coefficient analysis was used to elicit the correlations. The analyses revealed that the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; level of techno pedagogical competencies is high and their level of epistemological beliefs is medium. Gender and academic grade point average were found to be not leading to significant differences in their techno pedagogical subject-area competencies. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation was found between the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; techno pedagogical subject-area competencies and epistemological beliefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Open and Flexible Learning is an excellent method of reaching all types of learners. It is truly a medium that helps to democratize education to all. Today, we are currently experiencing a time of constant evolution in the field of education in which students require more resources and tools to obtain the information and construction of knowledge. One such resource is the use of open and distance learning environment, where the lecturer assigns additional activities for the understanding of the concepts seen before. But there are times when the student does not understand the content because of the form it represents, making it necessary to have more options to facilitate the understanding of content through different ways that may be more attractive to the students, achieving more active participation in the subject and an affinity that leads to a better learning experience. This is the goal of the study, which proposes a model called &ldquo;Learning Buffet Model&rdquo; for designing Open and Flexible Learning content adaptable to the student ́s learning style. This learning buffet model can be used as a fundamental model and applied in any area or discipline of education as it forces the consideration of four components (leaning style, content, pedagogy and technology) in the design of the lesson plan and subsequently enrich the learning environment with more specific learning objects the subjects taught.&rdquo;</p>

The Asia-Pacific Education Researcher, 19(5), 239-247. doi:10.1007/s40299-017-0344-3</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The development of e-learning and digital campus has prompted more and more teachers to assign online homework to students. Consequently, teachers need to provide sufficient and relevant guidance for such homework. Teachers&rsquo; online homework guidance (TOHG) is conceptually connected with their level of technological pedagogical content knowledge about educational use of Web (TPACK-W). This study employed two questionnaires: a self-developed questionnaire for TOHG and a revised TPACK-W questionnaire to study how TOHG is associated with TPACK-W through correlation and regression analysis. Two hundred and eighty-four teacher participants from China who had experience in assigning online homework were asked to complete the questionnaires. This study validated the questionnaires and established significant relationship between the TOHG and TPACK-W. The study expanded current understanding of TPACK through the factors associated with online homework. The findings showed that the level of teachers&rsquo; online homework guidance was significantly related to their TPACK-W, and the two factors of Web-Pedagogical Knowledge and Web-Pedagogical-Content Knowledge in the TPACK-W questionnaire could predict the TOHG. Future teachers&rsquo; professional development for the construction of TPACK-W should include discussions and guidelines of online homework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study examined the impact of implementing technology in teaching and learning the literature component in the Department of English, Faculty of Arts, University of Khartoum. A mixed methodology involved thirty 3rd year students and 14 teachers in the department of English in the process of data collection. Two sets of questionnaires were distributed among the teachers and students to examine their use, attitudes and reasons for which they might not use technology in teaching and learning as well as the way the teachers integrate technology. Interviews were set with two literature teachers to detect the problems encountered when teaching literature, in addition to an interview with the head of the department to provide a general idea about the situation of technology integration in teaching in the department. A classroom observation rubric was utilized, examining three literature lectures, to highlight the techniques used by teachers in teaching literature. A case study involved the thirty students in an investigation of the impact of technology on teaching and learning literature. The findings concluded that technology has a positive impact on the teaching and learning process. However, literature teachers use traditional techniques when teaching literature though results indicated the teachers&rsquo; as well as the students&rsquo; high positive attitudes towards using technology. Nevertheless, the students&rsquo; use of technology is higher than that of their teachers&rsquo; in the department. Therefore, the research suggested that the literature syllabus should be rewritten adopting more innovative techniques in teaching. It also suggested that the Department of English should consider providing the necessary equipment as well as teacher training programs to ameliorate the teaching and learning situation and to enable both teachers and students to cope up with the requirements of the 21st century rapidly changing world.&rdquo;</p>

Intentional implementation: A self-study examining and evaluating instructional implementation of digital tools to foster academic writing in the English secondary classroom (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10275103)</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This self-study examines the planning, practices, policies, and procedures present in a blended learning classroom environment to develop academic writing with tenth and eleventh grade public high school students. Digital technology is a prevalent and powerful force intertwined with most aspects of the human experience in the twenty-first century. As school systems, educators, and teacher educators try to respond to and within this rapidly evolving climate, they are confronted with challenges on many fronts, including infrastructure, professional development, teaching practice, policy, and further compounded by fiscal limitations. This effort is additionally challenged by a high-stakes testing climate in which state exam scores are used to evaluate the performance of the student, teacher, school, district, and state levels. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is the frame predominantly used in academic literature to articulate, explore, and understand the aspects in play in the 21st-century classroom. Two practices implemented with digital tools to support academic writing development, discussion boards and digital document submissions/revisions were studied. Digital document submission/revision was found to have a positive relationship with fostering improved attitudes towards revision and about students&rsquo; own writing efficacy. This practice was most successful when classroom policies were modified to account for the shift in the nature of the task and its role in student learning. This self-study suggests a fourth dimension of knowledge is necessary to understand and implement digital technology in the classroom. Organizational knowledge (OK) includes: classroom policies, the arrangement of physical and virtual spaces, and classroom management in physical and virtual spaces. Technological Organizational Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TOPACK) would integrate OK into the framework, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of what teachers need to know when implementing instructional technology in their classrooms. While some have included classroom management under the pedagogical knowledge branch of TPACK, I suggest that this fails to acknowledge the larger OK needed beyond the knowledge of how best to teach and is a limited perception of the purpose of classroom management. Navigating institutional and procedural considerations also impact classroom operations. Additional research is needed in the area of OK and how its components are impacted by the inclusion of digital technologies in the 21st-century classroom and to confirm the findings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Makerspaces have experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, resulting in an influx of Maker education in K-12 settings. While Makerspaces have been studied abundantly in museums, libraries, and in after-school programs, little research has been conducted inside the K- 12 school day. The goal of this study is to discover insights of established Makerspaces inside the K-12 school environment. In this exploratory mixed methods study, educators were survived, examining school and participant demographics, Makerspace setup, as well as intersections of technology, content and pedagogy. Next the researcher conducted a follow-up interview with selected participants based on diversity in the following key demographic areas: teacher gender, professional background, and school environment. In order to better understand K-12 implementation of Makerspaces, the study examines seven characteristics of Makerspaces: setting, computational thinking, participant structures, teacher training, gender and racial issues, assessment, and sustainability. The data was examined through TPACK framework with a constructivist approach.</p>
<p>Makerspaces can empower students to invent, prototype, and tinker with low-cost technology tools such as microcircuits and fabrication tools such as 3d printers. The goal of this study is to add to the body of literature regarding the role and potential value of Makerspaces in school environments. This exploration of Makerspaces in K-12 setting could be generalized to serve as a guide for teachers who want to establish their own Makerspace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davis, E.B. (2017). A mixed-methods study of a teacher preparation program: Preservice teachers&rsquo; perceived preparedness to integrate technology effectively (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10278387)<br />Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which preservice teachers within a teacher preparation program perceived themselves to be prepared to integrate technology, specifically examining the level of confidence preservice teachers perceive themselves to have towards TPACK-related skills needed to integrate technology into their instruction. Participants in this research study were solicited based on their enrollment in the selected teacher preparation program within the last 5 years; also included were current seniors enrolled in their final semester before degree completion. This research study contains a sample size of 20 participants from a small, private university in western North Carolina. All of the participants were preservice teachers either presently employed in a public education setting after graduation or currently enrolled in the teacher preparation program at the university; and all sought or are seeking certification in grades kindergarten through twelfth grade. Like many other teacher preparation programs across the United States, this university focuses on continued improvement in preparing preservice teachers to enter future classrooms equipped with technology as part of the learning environment. Three questions were addressed in this study: (1) To what extent does the teacher preparation program adequately prepare the preservice teachers to integrate technology in their classroom pedagogical practices? (2) To what extent does modeling by instructors influence the disposition preservice teachers have towards integrating technology into their classroom practice? (3) To what extent does technology knowledge play a role in the preservice teacher&rsquo;s confidence towards technology integration? A mixed-methods research design was used to explore the preparation of preservice teachers who received their training at a small, private, western North Carolina university. The Survey of Pre-service Teachers&rsquo; Knowledge of Teaching and Technology (Schmidt et al., 2009) was used to gather both quantitative as well as qualitative data pertaining to the participants. The quantitative data gathered were analyzed by grouping 5-point Likert-scale responses into positive and negative responses using percentages to identify overall perceptions based on the seven domains of Mishra and Koehler&rsquo;s (2006) TPACK framework. Additionally, the researcher utilized the qualitative responses given by participants from the open-ended questions at the end of the survey as well as during a focus group to strengthen the quantitative data and formulate answers to the posed research questions. Each set of data was analyzed separately, which allowed for triangulation (Creswell, 2009). The positive results produced by the survey results and focus-group responses conveyed how preservice teachers perceive they have been prepared to effectively integrate technology in their classroom lessons; however, the researcher recommends further research into preservice teachers&rsquo; capacity to integrate technology through continuous assessment and reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green, W.L. (2017). Educator technological pedagogical content knowledge and student achievement (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10249516)</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to develop a typology of teachers within the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and to identify the groups of teachers that perform better in regards to student achievement as measured by state mandated standardized assessment. A sample of 252 educators from a rural Georgia school district completed a 50- question TPACK survey. The survey data were used as input for k-means cluster analysis, which yielded three teacher profiles: a) High-TPACK, b) Mid-TPACK, and c) Low-TPACK. Demographic data of educators, years of experience, level of education, age, were tabulated by cluster. Results showed that the High-TPACK cluster (N=96) were made up of typically younger teachers, and predominately male. The Mid-TPACK (N=143) cluster skewed older with a majority of female educators. The Low-TPACK cluster (N=14) was made up of educators towards the end of their careers. A chi-square test showed that levels of student achievement differed significantly across the three clusters with a score of &chi;2(8)= 15.851 with p=.045 due to more students performing at a higher level on standardized assessment from the High-TPACK Cluster. Further, a t-test showed that the average percentage of students meeting and exceeding standards was significantly higher in the High-TPACK cluster than in the Mid-TPACK cluster (t(97)=-3.045, p=.004).</p>
<p>These results indicate that teachers with higher levels of TPACK have students who perform better on standardized assessment. These teachers&rsquo; types consisted of teachers that skewed younger and were more willing to take risks to explore technology integration. Suggestions were made for teacher preparation programs as well as professional development to target skills needed to get all teachers to the level of High-TPACK.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The march of technology creates new learning goals and challenges teachers to improve their technological skills. Teacher education&rsquo;s task is to prepare pre-service teachers to confront these challenges and guide them to make use of the new digital learning environments. By studying pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical knowledge one can find out what kind of guidance do pre-service teachers need to work as an innovative in-service teacher. This thesis discusses lesson plans made by pre-service primary teachers from the perspective of technological pedagogical content knowledge. Theories of conceptions of teaching and learning, the national core curriculum for basic education implemented in fall 2016, previous research in educational technology and visions of future technology are also taken in to account as underlying theories. The data consists of 60 lesson plans, which included 238 different teaching activities. Qualitative content analysis was used to determine technological and pedagogical knowledge in the activities. Pedagogical knowledge was described through used teaching methods as conceptions of teaching and learning. Technological knowledge was described through the devices and software used. Technological pedagogical knowledge is combined from the results of TK and PK with ATLAS.ti software. The most often mentioned technologies in the lesson plans were tablets and office tools. It appears that pre-service teacher planned to use more student-centered activities than teacher-centered activities. Teaching methods used by pre-service teacher seemed to be mostly congruent with the core curriculum. Based on the results it appears that pre-service teachers were able to plan instructions with common educational ICT tools, but there were still some areas of improvement on pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge. The results and previous studies suggest that teacher education should encourage pre-service teacher to make use of the new innovative technologies. Teacher education should also help pre-service teachers to find suitable pedagogical solutions through practical experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The Strengthening Innovative Practice in Secondary Education (SIPSE) project was conceptualized to enhance teacher capacity in ICT competencies and skills to teach Science, Technology,<br />English and Mathematics (STEM) subjects in Kenya secondary schools. The aim of this research study was to critically appraise the innovation model in relation to teacher development for ICT use in classroom practice associated with the SIPSE project over two cycles of the pilot phase implementation. The model integrated an ICT Competency Framework for Teachers (ICT-CFT) and Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) frameworks into a phased modular approach (ICT-CFT-TPACK-in-practice) for teacher professional development. The research addressed key questions related to: the object of ICT use as perceived by head teachers and teachers; and the characteristics of teacher design for ICT use in STEM teaching and learning as evidenced in classroom activities at different stages of their professional learning journey in the SIPSE intervention. The study used a qualitative design basedresearch (DBR) methodology that was enhanced with the use of a &lsquo;TPACKtivity&rsquo; lens combining TPACK and Activity Theory (AT) to explore, explicate and communicate the findings. The study was conducted with a purposive sample of twenty-four teachers, four head teachers and four schools drawn from the wider SIPSE programme intervention. The research data was collected over three field visits carried out between September 2014 and February 2016. The qualitative research methods included individual interviews and focus group discussions with the teachers and the head teachers. Data were also drawn from documentation of lesson plans and peer-to-peer lesson observations. The findings were illuminating. They presented participant accounts of tensions and dissonances with the introduction of technology into their school and classroom practices that reflected similar issues revealed in the literature. However, the findings elucidated some nuanced shifts and unexpected teacher design narratives for technology use to support, improve and innovate STEM teaching and learning processes. They further revealed the importance of classroom processes as the centre stage for fostering teacher collective and continual design conversations for framing and reframing ICT use solutions appropriate to the affordances and realities of their classroom and school contexts. In this the findings contribute to the current discourse by offering a TPACKtivity framework centred on authentic classroom settings as a basis for developing and appraising models of professional development for ICT use that can inform practice, policy and research.&rdquo;</p>

Retrieved from https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/supporting-teachers-technology-integration-in-lesson-plans<br />Abstract: &ldquo;Lesson planning offers rich opportunities for teachers to consider and implement technology in the classroom. This dissertation investigated the design and effectiveness of supplementary information to assist pre-service teachers during the lesson planning process. Based on the Technological, Pedagogical, And Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, several sets of support materials were developed. All materials contained information about technology, pedagogy, and content, but differed with regard to how these types of information were organized. Some materials presented each type of information in a separate section whereas other materials used an integrated format in which multiple types of information were combined. These different configurations were compared in four experimental studies. The main findings indicate that pre-service teachers prefer and benefit most from integrated support when thinking about the use of technology in their lessons. However, additional support or sustained practice seems needed to ensure high-quality technology integration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lavadia, L. (2017). Technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK): An educational landscape for tertiary science faculty (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10280318)</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Earlier studies concluded that technology&rsquo;s strength is in supporting student learning rather than as an instrument for content delivery (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2014). Current research espouses the merits of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework as a guide for educators&rsquo; reflections about technology integration within the context of content and instructional practice. Grounded by two theoretical frameworks, TPACK (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; 2008) and Rogers&rsquo; (1983, 1995) theory of diffusion of innovation, the purpose of this mixed-methods research was two-fold: to explore the perceived competencies of tertiary science faculty at higher education institutions with respect to their integration of technology within the constructs of pedagogical practice and content learning and to analyze whether these perceived competencies may serve as predictive factors for technology adoption level. The literature review included past research that served as models for the Sci-TPACK instrument. Twenty-nine professors of tertiary science courses participated in an online Likert survey, and four professors provided in-depth interviews on their TPACK practices. Quantitative analysis of data consisted of descriptive and reliability statistics, calculations of means for each of the seven scales or domains of TPACK, and regression analysis. Open-ended questions on the Likert survey and individual interviews provided recurrent themes of the qualitative data. Final results revealed that the participants integrate technology into pedagogy and content through a myriad of TPACK practices. Regression analysis supported perceived TPACK competencies as predictive factors for technology adoption level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The present study explored the effect of animation implementation in learning a chemistry topic. 135 high school students taking chemistry class were selected for this study (quasi-experimental groups = 67 and control groups = 68). Independent samples t-tests were run to compare animation and control groups between and within the schools. The over-arching finding of this research indicated that when science teachers used animations while teaching salt dissolution phenomena, students will benefit the application of animations. In addition, the findings informed the TPACK framework on the idea that visual tools are important in students&rsquo; understanding of salt dissolution concepts.&rdquo;</p>

It was an opportunity to observe how a teacher&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge operates in a classroom in response to the building, district and state contexts. It was conducted in multiple classrooms in one school and with science teachers. It included a self-study component. It provided an opportunity to directly observe the interactions between students and teacher as distinct species in the classroom when technology integration occurred. This allowed me to determine how observing other teacher&rsquo;s technology integration efforts impacted my own use in my classroom. I hope to provide an emic perspective on technology integration and broaden the definition of effective technology integration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is inevitable that campus-based higher education will adopt some form of a hybrid learning approach. For schools and their faculty members, this means the acknowledgment and acceptance of these changes are required. Campus-based higher education faculty members wish to change how they teach courses due to societal demands to better suit the next generation of students. Initially, schools began offering new technology to faculty that wished to use the technology; however, over the years, due to the demands of competition with other schools and next generation, tech-savvy students entering academia, schools are starting to require the use of technology that was once only an option for faculty members. This implementation of incorporating technology into the classroom has faced several roadblocks because what was once considered a simple transition has become more complex due to faculty resistance to new technology, which stems from various limitations, barriers, and perceptions, such as low computer self-efficacy, high computer anxiety, and time to learn new technology. The purpose of this study was to understand how in-service faculty experience individualized training as a method of teaching faculty how to use the technology and integrate it into their courses. The lived experiences and perceptions of in-service faculty regarding individualized training were specifically focused on to determine how individualized instruction was perceived to help or hinder integrating technology into their courses. The focus was the experience Harper College and McLennan Community College&rsquo;s in-service faculty, who experienced training through the group training currently offered by the schools, as well as the proposed individualized training. Higher education faculty from general study areas, such as English, math, and science were invited to participate. The study consisted of a 6-week individualized training program for 12 in-service faculty members (seven completed the study) who previously participated in a group training program about Blackboard. The study was a phenomenological approach in that used interviews to gather information regarding the lived experiences as the basis of analysis. The data for this study were gathered, horizonalized, and analyzed through a 7-step data processing method for phenomenology studies. After the data were analyzed, the findings show how developing a good individualized training program can help in-service faculty members not only integrate technology into their course designs but address any of the limitations or barriers the faculty faced. These findings coincide with the recommendations that training programs need to be developed into a phased approach in which the existing group training should continue but a secondary training program should be developed that incorporates andragogy-based principles and the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miller, S.B. (2017). Teachers&rsquo; use of instructional moves during technology-based mathematical activities (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database (UMI No. 10270262).</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates instructional moves by teachers in mathematics classrooms in which technology-based activities (i.e., student-oriented simulations) and features of those simulations influence classroom practices. Four teachers were studied over the course of a year as an exploratory study to build interpretive cases that described instructional practices in technology- based lessons. Teachers developed lessons using PhET simulations designed to support algebraic reasoning. Data sources included teachers&rsquo; process of selecting and designing lessons, observations of teachers&rsquo; non-technology and technology-based mathematical activities, and teacher interviews and reflections. This work was based on a conceptual framework blending the ideas of Mathematical Tasks (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 1998), Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), in which teachers&rsquo; instructional practices are determined by teachers&rsquo; mathematical pedagogical content knowledge, task selection and design, and use of technology. Results indicated that teachers see simulations as having significant benefits in the classroom. Teachers leveraged these opportunities by increasing class discussions, engaging in higher levels of thinking and reasoning, and focusing on mathematical representations. When teachers used simulations, the teachers spent less time in direct instruction, focused more on the mathematics, and focused more on investigations rather than drill-oriented tasks. Technology in the classroom, however, was problematic for some teachers. The very nature of students working independently with their own devices meant that student-student interactions decreased in some lessons. Furthermore, teachers&rsquo; discomfort in managing technology seems to limit ongoing use.<br />Specific features of the simulations that prompted instructional moves included the ability to support conceptual understanding and build student engagement. Simulations also provided a &lsquo;low floor, high ceiling,&rsquo; supporting differentiation, and a dynamic responsiveness, facilitating connections between representations. On the other hand, teachers raised concerns that some features of the simulation could do the math for the students. Furthermore, the perception of simulations as being a game may impact how and when simulations are used.<br />The emergent use of technology in math classrooms is under-supported. For simulations to be used in a more extensive fashion in mathematics classes, professional development and curricular materials are needed to support implementation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigated the conditions for developing science teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). It also explored the opportunities offered by two strategies to enhance science teachers&rsquo; ability to design technology-based inquiry activities for science learning: Experiencing Inquiry Model (EIM) and Metacognitive Scaffolding (MS). These strategies were adopted to support the processing necessary for developing teachers&rsquo; knowledge and for negotiating the integration of computer technology in science instruction. Situated Cognition Theory was used as a theoretical framework for learning, and TPACK was used as a conceptual framework for technology integration. 33 science teachers from four intermediate and high schools participated in the study. 17 and 16 teachers were conveniently assigned to EIM and MS, respectively. The study employed a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative evidence. As per the quantitative method, a quasi-experimental design that employed the 2 Teaching Strategy (EIM or MS) &times; 2 Time (pre- and post-intervention) of learning split-plot factorial design was applied in the study. Concurrently with the quantitative data collection, the qualitative evidence was collected from the researcher&rsquo;s logbook, participants&rsquo; written documents, and interviews. The findings suggested that there were no significant differences between EIM and MS for developing the knowledge components embodied in TPACK. Nevertheless, the participants who learned through the MS strategy outperformed their counterparts in designing technology-based inquiry activities for science learning. The latter result suggested that teachers who received metacognitive scaffolding were more equipped to connect curriculum goals with technology and instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this qualitative, multiple case study was to examine the decisions three teachers made while planning to integrate portable technology in technology-rich elementary classrooms. The three participants were selected by their district&rsquo;s Digital Learning Coordinator because of their high level of technology integration. The study investigated these teachers&rsquo; planning habits for instruction incorporating portable technology, such as Chromebooks. Observations, interviews, and lesson plan reviews constituted the qualitative data collected during approximately eight weeks. Peer debriefing, along with member checks, guaranteed that themes did not have a limited point of view, establishing credibility and dependability (Anney, 2014, Carspecken, 1996; Day, 2015). The Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) model was a useful descriptor for each teacher&rsquo;s technology planning level, and each used their own level of TPACK to drive their integration of technology in their classrooms and in their planning. The three participants utilized one-to-one (1:1) technology with varying degrees of effectiveness, and each planned differently for its use. The cross-case analysis guided the formation of four assertions: a) Experienced teachers with technology at their disposal are unlikely to change their planning, but will simply include technology when they deem it an appropriate and convenient tool to achieve their ends; b) Standardized technology does not necessarily lead to standardized uses or planning; c) Observable high and even skillful use of technology does not necessarily indicate strong planning; and d) Teachers are not motivated to change the way they plan when their students consistently excel at high stakes tests. The study findings have implications for teacher educators, teachers, and school and district leaders. Understanding how one&rsquo;s own level of TPACK and beliefs affect the choices teachers make during planning for technology integration can guide teachers and districts to identify teachers&rsquo; specific needs in order to make a 1:1 initiative successful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Education is one area where the use of technology has had great impact on student learning. The integration of technology in teaching and learning can significantly influence the outcome of education in the classroom. However, there are a myriad of factors that influence technology integration in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation of teacher integration of technology into classroom instruction. Factors that teachers perceive as being the most influential will be analyzed. The investigation also serves to inform school leaders about specific ways to ensure maximum use of instructional technology by all staff members.</p>
<p>The study involved a comprehensive high school centrally located in a suburban county in Maryland with an on-time graduation of above 95%. This study surveyed 49 teachers who are employed at this high school and represent various years&rsquo; experience. Their teaching assignments range from standard level to advanced placement courses in one of the following content areas: English, science, social studies, or math. The research design in this study is quantitative in nature and was conducted through an on-line anonymous, eleven question survey using the Qualtrics platform.</p>
<p>A total of 44/49 participants, or 90%, provided responses to all of the questions asked on the anonymous survey. Results indicated that content, grade, skill level of student, and years&rsquo; experience had no effect on the integration of technology in the classroom as 84% reported daily integration. Smart Boards and Laptops were the most frequently used while responders/clickers and the document camera were the least frequently used. Teachers reported using the Internet to develop lessons, Moodle, and video clips from the Internet were the most common uses of technology. Furthermore, results indicated that personal interest, availability, and professional development had the greatest influence over a teacher&rsquo;s decision to integrate technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This case study was developed to understand pre-service teachers&rsquo; perceptions of their abilities to integrate technology into the classroom, and to understand their perceptions of how those abilities developed. The case that was investigated in this study is the teacher preparation program at a small comprehensive college located in the upper Great Plains region of the United States. Utilizing a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, both a survey as well as semi-structured interviews provided data to understand pre-service teachers&rsquo; perceptions of their preparation for technology integration. The TPACK framework for technology integration (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) and self- efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986, 1997) were used as a theoretical framework for understanding pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy for technology integration. The results of this study indicate that pre-service teachers generally feel confidence with regard to their abilities to integrate technology, but also feel a sense of pressure to be able to teach with technology. The results further suggest that there are a variety of things teacher educators can do to support pre-service teachers in their learning to integrate technology, including modeling technology integration, providing both formal and informal learning opportunities to develop technological knowledge and skills, and helping pre-service teachers understand the link between technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and content knowledge. Additionally, the pre- service teachers participating in this study indicated that they believe a practical course in technology integration would help to prepare them for teaching in contemporary classrooms. Based on the findings of this research, a plan of action is suggested for teacher educators interested in fostering pre-service teachers&rsquo; abilities to integrate technology in the classroom.&rdquo;<br />Rios-Parnell, A.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Researchers agreed with the fact that online learning will continue for a long time and that its growth will continue for many years. However, a concern exists regarding training that is offered to online higher education instructors based on the professional and technological skills they should master as online instructors. Based on an increased and continue reliance on online remote adjunct faculty members, it is imperative for leaders at higher education institutions to assess not only how the instructors feel about their jobs, duties, and responsibilities and what aspects contribute most to their level of satisfaction with professional and technological development (PTechD) received, but to have a PTechD with an effective evaluation process in place to ensure the online remote adjunct instructors receive the necessary professional and technological skills to be successful online remote adjunct instructors. The main goal of the current study was to formulate some characteristics for a professional and technological development (PTechD) program for online remote adjunct instructors and for the instructors&rsquo; evaluation processes after a PTechD is received. The study was used to examine how instructors perceived their level of preparedness with received PTechD. The qualitative descriptive case study involved the topic of a PTechD program for online remote adjunct instructors in a higher education institution. Data were collected using a survey methodology, an instructor self-reflection assessment, and an interview process to describe the level of satisfaction online-adjunct instructors have with the professional and technological development (PTechD) program at their institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology integration in teaching had receive growing attention in the digital age and many studies had shown positive results in promoting students learning. However, most of the studies emphasized on the outcome of students&rsquo; learning but less research about the teachers&rsquo; competency to integrate technology in teaching. Additionally, majority of the elementary school teachers are not teaching as per their subject expertise. Teachers with non-science background and lack of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) may have low self-efficacy toward teaching with technology. Therefore, developing an appropriate instrument is needed for assessing and measuring self-efficacy of elementary in-service teachers in teaching mathematics with information and communications technology (ICT). This instrument can serve as foundation in teachers training and teacher professional development for improvement of teacher education and the future of mathematics education. This study aims to develop a new self-efficacy scale, namely Self-efficacy in Teaching Mathematics with ICT for in-service mathematics teacher. Besides, current study presents the results of exploratory factor analysis of elementary in-service mathematics teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The present study addresses the lack of a theoretical framework for the integration of technology in music teaching and learning, and explores, within the framework of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK), the importance of affect in instructional design. The study extends the theoretical framework of TPCK to a design framework and proposes a methodology and instructional design guidelines that address both the cognitive and the affective domains of learning. The research has both practical and theoretical significance as it provides teachers with explicit guidance on how to design music lessons based on TPCK principles and examines interactions among content, technology, and affect.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from http://www.icicte.org/ICICTE_2017_Proceedings/SSP1_Macride%20Christofides%202017.pdf)</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;There has been an increased emphasis on the integration of engineering design with science learning across all grades in the school curriculum. A critical aspect of this integration process is understanding teacher preparedness and their knowledge about the technology, content, and pedagogy relevant for the effective implementation of such integrated curriculum. Prior research suggests that teachers may not be prepared to integrate technologies and other scaffolds that are crucial for students&rsquo; productive engagement with engineering design. Teaching technology skills isolated from the classroom context in which they need to be implemented does not help. Thus, the need of the hour is classroom environments that provide teachers opportunities for engaging deeply and meaningfully with the technology and scaffolding the implementation of technology to support science and engineering learning. We present findings from a study that investigates teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge in the context of a project-based unit using a CAD tool.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This case study utilized the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) theoretical framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) as a lens to examine the instructional strategies of four English as a second language (ESL) teachers and their rationales for incorporating technology into their instructional practices in teaching oral communication skills. The four teachers taught adult learners at the intermediate and advanced levels of an English Language program at a university in the Southeastern United States in spring of 2015. The survey results reported low mean scores in teachers&rsquo; technological knowledge but higher mean scores for the constructs of technological content knowledge, technological pedagogical knowledge, and TPACK. The data gathered from class observations and interviews suggested that teachers&rsquo; pedagogical approaches determined the extent to which technology was used in class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;A main issue in educating engineer educators on how to integrate technology in teaching is to make them (a) appreciate pedagogical theories as a guide for designing effective learning contexts, as well as (b) approach technology as a cognitive tool instead of a learning outcome &ndash; as they usually do due to the close connection of their discipline with technological advances. It is especially challenging but necessary for integrating technology in a constructivist context, to stimulate conceptual and instructional changes, preparing teachers to focus on pedagogy, content, and technology as well as on the way they need to appropriately combine them in order to design learner-centered, technology enhanced contexts. In this paper, we propose an approach for educating engineer educators on TEL that uses WebQuests as the main methodological tool for cultivating technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). Through WebQuests we aim to cultivate pedagogical and technological skills to student engineers. At the same time, we aim at stimulating them to reflect and elaborate on their subject matter and on how to design learning in an authentic context.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from<br />http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7943007/)</p>
<p>Rahman, S. M. M., Chacko, S. M., &amp; Kapila, V. (2017, June), Building trust in robots in robotics-focused STEM education under TPACK framework in middle schools. Paper presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition, Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Nonetheless, based on our experience, we believe that despite its tremendous potential robotics cannot be widely incorporated into STEM education curricula until teachers and students develop trust in the robotics. Here, trust of teachers and students in robotics indicates their willingness to believe in the solutions provided by robots and to rely on the contributions of robots in STEM teaching and learning. Human trust in robots is extensively explored in fields such as service, manufacturing, etc. However, trust of teachers and students in robots in robotics-focused STEM education has not been studied yet. This paper is based on our collaboration with 20 teachers of 8 urban, inner-city schools and observations of over 200 students in their robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK framework. Using appropriate questionnaire techniques, we develop a &lsquo;trust vocabulary&rsquo; that contains what the teachers and the students mean by trust in the robots for their lessons, and what factors and features of the robotics may affect their trust. Next, we develop a qualitative trust assessment method using a Likert scale and derive a quantitative trust computational model. We compare the qualitative and quantitative trust measurements and validate the quantitative trust model. We propose several hypotheses and investigate whether there are statistically significant differences in trust in robots between teachers and students, teaching subjects such as science and math, and participants&rsquo; genders. We analyze whether the level of trust of the teachers in robotics effects their pedagogy and the level of trust of the students effects their learning methods. Based on the trust assessment results, we conduct a survey with the teachers and students and offer recommendations that may help enhance the trust levels of the teachers and students in the robotics for STEM education.<br />The results are novel that may advocate using robotics as a trust-worthy pedagogical tool under the TPACK framework, argue incorporating robotics into STEM education curricula in middle schools, and help maintain appropriate levels of trust of teachers and students in robots, which may increase the overall learning outcomes.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from https://peer.asee.org/27990)</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK (technological-pedagogical-content knowledge) is a conceptual framework that reflects the status of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of educators. The TPACK framework allows teachers to use technology as an effective pedagogical tool to present disciplinary knowledge in readily accessible ways to students, promote active learning, and assist students in comprehending content that is pedagogically challenging. Recent proliferation of robotics as a technology component to facilitate effective pedagogy requires further investigation into TPACK because the teachers not only need to know how to operate robotics under TPACK, but also to incorporate it into teaching their assigned curriculum. Furthermore, situated cognition theory can help guide the development of robotics-focused TPACK, which is dynamic in nature and various factors and contexts may affect its efficacy. However, prior research has not devoted significant effort to explore the dynamic nature of TPACK for teaching STEM in robotics-focused classrooms. In this paper, we explore the dynamic nature of TPACK for teaching STEM with robotics in middle school classrooms. We collaborate with 20 teachers in eight urban, inner-city schools and observe their teaching of robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK. Using questionnaires, we identify the ideal requirements of teachers&rsquo; TPACK to effectively teach STEM lessons using robotics. We also determine the relative importance of the various domains of TPACK. Next, using questionnaires and brainstorming, we identify the factors that may affect the requirements of the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge and their relative importance. We investigate different strategies and awareness levels of TPACK in different schools. We develop an assessment method to assess the self-efficacy of the teachers to teach robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK. We analyze the reasons behind the deficits in the self-efficacy scores and provide recommendations to improve TPACK self-efficacy of the teachers. The results are novel and fundamental that may contribute to expand the conceptual horizon of TPACK, develop and maintain a balanced TPACK for teaching STEM with robotics in middle schools, and also maintain appropriate self-efficacy levels of the teachers, which may enhance the overall learning outcomes of the students.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from https://peer.asee.org/28336)<br />Setiyanti, A.A., &amp; Hunt, J.

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) has, in recent years, been the focus of considerable research, particularly in subject specific domains. This paper explores the ideas of TPACK and its relationship to Indonesian elementary pre-service teachers. Links are drawn between Hunt&rsquo;s (2015) use of graphic organisers to explore teaching practices, curriculum connectedness, attributes of the teacher and use of ICT artifacts and a theoretical planning tool, TRIM, the Technological Reflective Integration Matrix (Setiyanti &amp; Hunt, 2016). The outcomes outlined here are preliminary, but encourage the researchers to improve the TRIM model as a way to capture a broader picture of TPACK in a domain not well researched &mdash; elementary pre-service teachers.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from<br />http://www.icicte.org/ICICTE_2017_Proceedings/2.3_Setiyanti__Hunt_.pdf)</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The authors herein discuss the design of e-TPCK, a self-paced adaptive electronic learning environment that was integrated in a second-year educational technology course to engage pre-service teachers&rsquo; in rich learning experiences in order to develop their TPCK in a personalized way. The system deploys a technological solution that promotes teachers&rsquo; ongoing TPCK development by engaging them in rich and valuable personalized learning experiences through the use of technology-infused design scenarios, while taking at the same time into account teachers&rsquo; diverse needs, information processing constraints, and preferences. Results from an experimental research design study revealed statistically significant differences between the control group and the experimental group in favor of the experimental group, signifying that students in the experimental group who learned with e-TPCK outperformed the students in the control group in terms of developing TPCK competencies.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 11:50 &ndash; 12:10 PM, Whitney</p>

Results from Rice University&rsquo;s WeTeach CS: A computer science teaching collaborative serving teachers with different needs through variety of pathways. Virtual paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52016/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Computer science (CS) is one of the school subjects that gained a great attention recently, yet it faces challenges such as teacher shortages and huge variability in teachers&rsquo; professional preparation. These challenges make PD efforts even more critical to develop in-service teachers to effectively teach CS topics. This paper presents results from Rice University School Mathematics Project&rsquo;s We Teach CS program, a CS teaching collaborative that provided 20 CS teachers with an innovative professional development. The innovation comes from the four different pathways to serve diverse needs of the teachers in the best way possible and each pathway having several components spread out to several months rather than being one-time, one-shot. The paper will describe each pathway in detail to set an example for other professional development programs. The overarching goal of the program was to develop the self-efficacy and pedagogical content knowledge, which as research shows are integral to successful CS teaching. This study focused on teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy for CS, CS teaching, and computational thinking, and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). Data collection means include pre- and post-surveys, teacher reflections, and teach interviews. The results are promising in that the collaborative improved teachers in all these areas. The paper also describes the different pathways in detail to provide an example of a successful CS teaching collaborative.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: All conference days (online)</p>

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52026/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In 2016 and 2017, California revised both its Teacher Performance Expectations (TPEs) and the teacher performance assessment. In 2017, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) revised its educator standards. This created a need for a TK-12 teacher preparation program to address preparing pre-service teachers to use educational technology. Institutional post-program survey responses indicate graduates feel unprepared to use educational technology. Initially, the researcher was to revise a technology exam to align with the new standards. The test was found to be an untenable solution. Instead, the program decided to use an online certification option to develop pre-service teacher technology knowledge (TK) of the standards at an introductory level. The program is developing a plan for integrating technology throughout its scope and sequence using a TPACK (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2009) approach for depth. This brief paper describes the work-in-progress using the SQD model proposed by Tondeur, et al. (2012).&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 3:20 PM-3:40 PM, Wright</p>

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52698/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Makerspaces are emerging as promising experiential learning environments that support the development of future ready skills, including collaboration, critical thinking, creativity and innovation, communication, and problem solving. This poster presentation shares the findings from a pilot study that explored what knowledge participants perceived they gained from participating in a makerspace experience. Preliminary findings suggest that participants perceived that they had 1) gained knowledge about how to facilitate maker experiences for their students, 2) gained the technical expertise and confidence to use the technologies explored during the makerspace in their own teaching, 3) were able to make curriculum connections with the activities explored in the makerspace, and 4) were able to identify the types of thinking skills being used in different centers. These findings suggest that TPACK knowledge of the participants was enhanced through interacting with tinkering and exploring within the informal learning environments of makerspaces.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Wednesday, March 28 6:15 PM-7:30 PM, Edison Ballroom D</p>
<p>Harris, J., &amp; Phillips, M. (2018, March). If there&rsquo;s TPACK, is there technological pedagogical reasoning and action? Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from http://new.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/51537/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The notion of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) was modified by multiple authors to become technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK or TPACK), spawning much active and dynamic scholarship since 2001. Currently, many researchers see TPCK/TPACK as the knowledge that teachers need to integrate technologies effectively into learning and teaching. Shulman&rsquo;s PCK, however, was just one element in a much larger conceptualization of a knowledge base for educators, and that full range of knowledge was posited as being used by teachers in recursive processes of pedagogical reasoning and action. This begs the question: if there is TPCK/TPACK, which is rooted in PCK, as many studies have suggested, is there also technological pedagogical reasoning and action (TPR&amp;A)? If so, what are its distinguishing characteristics? If not, why would TPCK not be mirrored in TPR&amp;A? These questions are addressed in the following multivocal literature review.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29th 1:45 PM-2:15 PM, Bell</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;With efforts to integrate technology into one&rsquo;s teaching practices, a teacher constructs Technological, Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Furthermore, when doing so as part of an action research, teachers more effectively develop TPACK as they critically examine and determine the strengths and weaknesses of their efforts via data collection, analysis, and reflection. In working with a secondary English teacher, Mary, who was working on her master&rsquo;s degree action research capstone project, I witnessed professional expertise change. Mary brainstormed and tried out a couple of new instructional strategies that included the use of cell phones and laptops in new ways. Mary constructed knowledge of instructional strategies and assessment with technology that supports student achievement in her English classroom and engages her students more meaningful in the learning process. With this knowledge, Mary is empowered and equipped to be a teacher leader where there is a school initiative to increase meaningful use of technology.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Wednesday, March 28 6:15 PM-7:30 PM, Edison Ballroom D</p>
<p>Jaramillo Cherrez, N. (2018, March).

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/51822/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This case study documented the critical reflective practice of an instructor in a higher education context. This reflective practice was characterized by critical analysis that examined her teaching and learning approaches. In particular, the reflections unveiled her ways of seeing the teaching and learning process, learning through sharing experiences, developing her Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), and nurturing her professional growth. Cultivating this reflective practice was possible through guided mentoring and collaboration with an instructional design team, during which the instructor was able to engage in in-depth critical reflective practices. Implications for cultivating reflective practice are discussed in light of enhancing our understanding of the complexities that teaching and learning processes encompass. Recommendations for cultivating critical reflection through mentoring and collaborating will also be shared.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 3:00-3:20 PM, Wright</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Prior knowledge, course design, and technology preparation play essential roles in pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK development In this paper, the researchers investigated the impact of prior knowledge, course design, and technology preparation on pre-service teachers&rsquo; post-TPACK and TPACK development scores in a required educational technology course Statistical analyses, two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), were run The researchers found that all three variables affected pre-service teachers&rsquo; post-TPACK and TPACK development scores In particular, cluster 2 pre-service teachers who reported higher pre-TPACK scores had higher post-TPACK scores The second course design, which integrated content-specific strategies guided by TPACK framework, was more effective for developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK in both clusters However, although cluster 1 pre-service teachers increased more in their TPACK development scores, they could not catch up with those in cluster 2 in both course designs The results of this paper provided empirical data on the impact of prior knowledge, course design, and technology integration on pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK development Future directions for research and practical implications were discussed.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Friday, March 30 10:15-10:45 AM, Edison G</p>

The purpose of this study was to analyze how to use the TPACK Levels Rubric (Lyublinskaya &amp; Tournaki, 2012) to measure pre-service and in-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK level based on various artifacts. The case study focused on a single pre-service teacher&rsquo;s lesson plan representing average TPACK level for the same population. The authors examined criteria of the TPACK Levels Rubric to understand the differences in levels of TPACK for each component of the TPACK Levels Rubric, developed examples of how the scored lesson plan would look like if it were one and two TPACK levels below or above the actual level to support the scoring procedure and to create guidelines for educators using this tool in assessing pre-service and in-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK level. The ongoing analysis of the rubric that focuses on unpacking criteria of the TPACK Levels Rubric will lead to the revision of the original rubric.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Wednesday, March 28 4:45 PM-5:15 PM, Edison E</p>

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52763/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study explores the relationship between preservice teachers&rsquo; self-reported assessment of technology knowledge and their actual technology integration into lesson plans. Students` responses to the TPACK survey (Schmidt, Baran, Thompson, Mishra, Koehler, &amp; Shin, 2009) and lesson plan rubric scores (Harris, Grandgenett &amp; Hofer, 2010) were collected in this study. Pearson correlation was conducted to analyze the relationship between students&rsquo; TPACK and their demonstrations of TPACK via lesson plans while descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyze to what extent preservice teachers incorporated TPACK into their lesson plans. The results indicate that there appears to be a mismatch between knowledge (theory) and practice of preservice teachers with respect their TPACK. That is, self-assessment of preservice teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge was found higher than their actual technology integration into lesson plans. Content analysis of the lesson plans revealed that the extent and use of digital technologies changed depending on the curriculum goals and instructional strategies.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Friday, March 30 10:45 AM-11:00 AM, Whitney</p>

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52513/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The present study addresses the lack of a theoretical framework for the integration of technology in music teaching and learning, and explores, within the framework of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge the importance of affect in instructional design. The authors propose a set of music-specific design principles based on the TPCK framework while identifying the interrelations among musical content, emotions, and technology. The design guidelines were tested in an empirical investigation and statistically significant differences were found between the control and the experimental groups in favor of the experimental group. Further investigation is necessary to test the effectiveness of the proposed design principles. Including affect in the design process is a complicated and mostly unchartered area, and, thus, further research toward this direction is fully justified. Through the inclusion of affect in the learning design, the research has practical and theoretical significance as it addresses a gap in both the TPCK/ TPACK and music education literature.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Tuesday, March 27 10:45 AM-11:15 AM, Edison A</p>

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52638/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this review of multiple reinterpretations of TPCK/TPACK that have emerged over time, we trace the construct&rsquo;s roots not only to PCK, but more importantly to Shulman&rsquo;s (1987) knowledge base for teaching, within which PCK was originally situated. We suggest that TPACK is a special case of PCK which sits within the considerably broader knowledge base for teaching, basing this assertion upon Cox&rsquo;s (2008) explanation of the differences between teachers&rsquo; PCK and TPACK. Following Cox, we argue that TPACK references only the specific nature of a teacher&rsquo;s PCK when unfamiliar digital tools are considered and implemented for educational purposes. We recommend that TPACK researchers distinguish among the different categories of teachers&rsquo; knowledge, reasoning, and action more clearly, bounding TPACK more narrowly in ways that mirror how Shulman delineated PCK with reference to the six other components comprising his knowledge base for teaching.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29th 2:15 PM-2:45 PM, Bell</p>

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52029/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Recently, a boom in tech industries locating within a western state have led to the laying of hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable from north to south within the state&rsquo;s borders. The potential impact this will have on education for the more than 50,000 K-12 students living in rural and frontier communities along that route could be tremendous. A question raised is: are the districts administrators and instructional staff prepared to integrate technology into their curriculum? To facility a greater understanding of this preparedness, a technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) survey of the administrative and instructional staff will be completed. Analysis of the results will provide the base data to create a site-specific, individualized professional development program that will focus on use of technology and active integration in both core and elective courses to enhance student engagement, retention, and academic success.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 1:45 PM-2:45 PM, Edison Ballroom D</p>

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52510/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Our graduate course &lsquo;learning with ICT&rsquo; targets the development of TPACK through conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and educational design. In this study we qualitatively analyzed the outcomes of the course. The main research questions are: What conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and TPACK enactment are visible in students&rsquo; written and video assignments after the course? And how are these related? Qualitative analyses of conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and TPACK enactment was performed in the software package QDA miner with the help of a categorical dictionary and codebooks derived from the content of the course. The results showed that students differed greatly in their conceptual understanding and in their pedagogical reasoning. However, most students designed and enacted a lesson that showed TPACK enactment. This may mean that in some students TPACK enactment may merely be performance driven. Students with a strong conceptual understanding and pedagogical reasoning, may be more likely to show transfer of TPACK enactment to future teaching situations.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 3:40 &ndash; 4:00 PM, Wright</p>

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52544/</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this study, pre-service teachers (PSTs) in an instructional technology course used a visual quantitative model to track their growth in the seven knowledge domains associated with Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Written reflections by the PSTs provided insights into self-reported ratings that improved, stayed constant, or declined. Preliminary findings indicate that PSTs&rsquo; growth in TPACK was often attributed to the applied and practical nature of course activities as well as the PSTs&rsquo; increased confidence with using technology. PSTs were also able to describe actionable next steps to further grow their TPACK in areas that were stagnant. While few PSTs reported areas where knowledge declined, it is speculated that this was a result of PSTs initial overestimate of their knowledge.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 11:30-11:50 AM, Whitney</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teacher educators are often pressed to create experiences for future teachers to engage in the practice of teaching mathematics with technology. In this paper, we describe how preservice teachers in a methods class incorporated their knowledge of technology, mathematics, and pedagogy in a project of creating video lessons using an app called ExplainEverything on iPad. We characterize their experiences using the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Results from qualitative analysis suggest participants demonstrated effective use of technology, pedagogical techniques, and mathematical representations using technology. Implications for practice include a recommendation to implement a cycle of learning in which preservice teachers can refine their pedagogical strategies, the rigor in their mathematics, and their use of mathematical action technology.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Tue, April 17, 8:15 to 9:45 AM, Sheraton New York Times Square, Second Floor, Empire Ballroom East</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher demographic characteristics, value beliefs, and TPACK perceptions. 109 in-service teachers from the state of Ohio participated in this study. Our findings reveal that the relations of TPACK perceptions with demographic characteristics and value beliefs replicate those found in other research studies. Value beliefs, technology use, gender, and years of teaching significantly predict TPACK perceptions outside the context of intervention. In addition, value beliefs moderate the relations of TPACK perceptions with gender, age, and technology use. When the effects of demographic characteristics and value beliefs on TPACK perceptions are investigated in the context of intervention, teaching level and value beliefs are the only significant predictors of end-of-the-program TPACK perceptions.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Sat, April 14, 4:05 to 5:35 PM, New York Marriott Marquis, Seventh Floor, Chelsea/Gotham Room</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The role of Instructional coaches in technology for K12 schools has the potential to significantly impact teachers&rsquo; efficacy and use of technology in the classroom. This qualitative study was designed to explore how contextual factors influence instructional coaches&rsquo; ability to shape teachers&rsquo; development of technological, pedagogical and content knowledge and practice. This multiple case study examines the intentions, strategies and tensions of Instructional Coaches who support and provide professional development for inservice K-12 teachers. Cross-case analysis suggest context can shape the coaches&rsquo; ability to purposefully shape teachers&rsquo; TPACK. Although the majority of coaches spend time helping teachers integrate technology in their classroom, district mandates, expectations, and teachers&rsquo; efficacy were one of many barriers to technology use.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Tue, April 17, 12:25 to 1:55 PM, New York Hilton Midtown, Third Floor, Americas Hall 1-2 &ndash; Exhibit Hall</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Developing teachers who can effectively integrate technology is critical for addressing the needs of today&rsquo;s students and the changes wrought by rapidly emerging learning environments. This study compared the impact of flipped and face-to-face course versions on preservice teachers&rsquo; technology integration knowledge. Using an embedded mixed methods design, preservice teachers&rsquo; self-perceptions and application of TPACK were measured via a pre- and post- course survey and lesson plans, prompted reflections, and semi-structured interviews. The results revealed that preservice teachers significantly improved their knowledge of how to use various technologies with content specific instructional methods. These findings demonstrate the potential of this instructional design model in this context and lay the groundwork for replication with alternative instructional approaches.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Mon, April 16, 4:05 to 5:35 PM, Sheraton New York Times Square, Second Floor, Empire Ballroom East</p>

<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This review of research examined how researchers defined and employed the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) knowledge categories within qualitative research studies set within teaching and teacher education. The review examined (through a qualitative research process) how definitions and data examples were coded using the TPACK conceptual framework and its knowledge sub-types. This research revealed researchers are using incomplete or completely different definitions of TPACK knowledge areas, and knowledge sub-types are not equally represented within definitions and data examples. The review built a TPACK qualitative codebook that can support more reliable, valid, generalizable, and trustworthy TPACK-related research and provides practice-based examples that may assist in teaching TPACK to teachers.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Fri, April 13, 12:00 to 1:30 PM, New York Marriott Marquis, Fifth Floor, Westside Ballroom Salon 4</p>

Findings reveal widespread similarities in attitudes toward teaching and learning across all different departments and indicate that, while faculty members had a range of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge inferences, many faculty discussed tensions located at the nexus of technological knowledge, content knowledge, and pedagogical knowledge.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Mon, April 16, 2:15 to 3:45pm, New York Marriott Marquis, Fourth Floor, Wilder</p>
<p>Soodjinda, D. (2018, April). The TPA game-changer: Pushing for equity, inclusion, and educational technology via teacher performance assessment. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In 2016, a state credentialing agency adopted a new set of Teacher Performance Expectations (TPEs) that highlights: A) an in-depth usage of technology to enhance instruction; B) the impact of K-12 students&rsquo; assets as &ldquo;funds of knowledge&rdquo; that can be used as a resource for instruction. In order to address the new TPEs the state agency was tasked with redeveloping their Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) with a goal that the new assessment drive teacher preparation programs to refocus their curriculum in areas relating to equity, inclusion, and educational technology.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which the redesigned state sponsored Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) is designed to disrupt traditional frameworks in teacher preparation that are anchored in deficit ideology and the superficial treatments of educational technology. Most teacher preparation programs address &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; through a multicultural approach that includes a single course about diversity that is embedded in curriculum, or through learning activities, integrated throughout the program, that requires candidates to plan for culturally driven learning activities that are often simplified to diverse celebrations and songs (Nieto, 2000). In both of these instances, the focus is on culture, which tends to essentialize students who come from marginalized groups instead of addressing the inequities that these students face in the classroom as it pertains to access and inclusion (Tyler, 2016; Gorski, 2016). With that, more recent research relating to &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; has called for a shift in teacher preparation that extends beyond multicultural approaches to more equity-driven instruction (Darling-Hammond, 2015; Gorski, 2016).</p>
<p>In alignment with these trends, this paper reviews how the redesigned TPA has included a number of elements that require candidates to gather data about their students that allows them to be more inclusive and equity-driven in their practices, so that student differences are viewed as resources and assets, instead of as deficits which continues to be present in the thinking among many teachers today (Lambeth &amp; Smith, 2016; Valencia, 2010). The inclusion of these elements emerged from the outcomes of design team perspectives, focus group data, and survey data that originated from pilot testing and an external bias review panel.</p>
<p>Additionally, this paper will also highlight how educational technology will be addressed in the redesigned TPA by asking candidates to enhance student learning experiences through technology. Currently, there is a disconnect between the technology related expectations that new teachers have in the classroom, and the type of training that is received in credential programs. For example, in many classrooms, there is currently a push for teachers to advance a model of teaching where technology, pedagogy and content knowledge intersect (TPACK). However, in many credential programs, TPACK is rarely discussed in content knowledge and pedagogical methods related courses. With the goal of utilizing technology in such a way that enhances learning, the redesigned TPA requires candidates to integrate technology into a lesson, provide a rationale for the technological interventions chosen, and to document their lesson via video.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Mon, April 16, 4:05 to 6:05 PM, New York Hilton Midtown, Concourse Level, Concourse B Room</p>

Abstract retrieved from<br />https://conference.iste.org/2018/program/search/detail_session.php?id=110818245</p>
<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Amplifying student voice is not a new concept. The ways in which we empower students to share and be heard are. In this session, you will learn about a variety of tools that allow students to: create content, work critically to solve problems, collaborate seamlessly beyond school walls, and communicate their learning to a global audience. With the innovation of various audio and video tools the walls of the classroom are no longer barriers, connected learning knows no limits, and student voice can be amplified in arenas that were previously unattainable. With a little guidance, students can explore options to learn, grow, and empower themselves and others to #becomebetter together. In this session, we will move beyond a simple tool discussion. We will use the SAMR and TPACK models to explore the connections between tools, content, and pedagogy so that students can soar beyond expectations and achieve more than was ever thought possible. Whether you teach kindergarten or college you will find something in this session that will apply to your students. We will show you how to harness the potential of tools like Flipgrid, DoInk and Soundtrap so your students&rsquo; voices are amplified for all to hear.&rdquo;<br />Focus: Digital Age Teaching &amp; Learning<br />Audience: Beginner<br />Date/Title: Wednesday, June 27, 11:00 am&ndash;1:00 pm</p>
