Mathematics education is one of the domains where one can see prominent and growing effect of technology. It is believed and studied widely that use of technology can have positive effect on Mathematics teaching and learning, yet there seem to be some apprehension on the part of the teachers in the use of technology. This paper has attempted to study perception of teachers in detail on the use of technology in their Mathematics teaching and learning. The perception is studied with respect to the factors &ndash; experience of teachers and level of education. The relation between the perception and each factor is studied statistically and inferences are drawn. The sample of given study consisted of the teachers teaching in schools with convenient access to technology.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ayg&uuml;n, B., Uzun, N., &amp; Atasoy, E. (2016).

In this qualitative study, teaching practices which was prepared in learning domain such as numbers and operations, algebra, geometry and measurement, statistics and probability and with different dynamic mathematical software (GeoGebra, Cabri3D and Tinkerplots) by 24 prospective mathematics teachers&rsquo; candidates were investigated. Data of study was collected through video records and lesson plans filled out by the prospective teachers after their teaching sessions. Data were analyzed within executing the teaching process and problem solving competency fields of technopedagogical education. Findings indicate that technology is used as an explorative tool for the first time in teaching the subject, technology based activities are prepared to prevent misconception; however, they were forced to use technology in assessment evaluation process.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bauer, W.

Abstract retrieved from http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/fmea/rpme/2016/00000018/00000001/art00001</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine how collegiate music teacher education programs prepare preservice teachers to utilize digital technology with K-12 music students. Fifty percent of NASM schools with music education programs (n = 250) were randomly selected. The head of music education or another music education professor from each institution was invited to complete an online survey regarding the role, nature, and efficacy of technology instruction in their program. Thirty-six percent (n = 89) responded. Of the responding schools, 47% of the programs reported their students participated in a course in music technology designed for all music majors, 33% required a music technology course specifically oriented to music education majors, 13% had students enroll in a technology class for education majors (non-music specific), and 78% integrated information and experiences related to the pedagogical uses of technology into music education classes. Preservice music teacher preparation was also examined within the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework. the TPACK domains that included technology were rated as being less developed than the non-technology domains. Respondents reported their preservice teachers were prepared at a proficient level to integrate current and future music technology, but indicated lower levels of readiness to teach music classes that were fully technology-based.

The data analysis of interviews, final projects, and videos yielded the following major findings. First, the digital natives&rsquo; TPCK was developed through collections of multimedia tools, teaching the digital immigrants, and activity designs. Second, these digital natives lacked competence in designing appropriate follow-up activities and tasks for the digital immigrants. Next, they also failed to provide step-by-step modelling and demonstration on using technology and multimedia tools. A framework on developing digital natives&rsquo; TPCK includes introduction of multimedia tools, provision of step-by-step modelling, recognition of adult learners&rsquo; needs, and designing interactive follow-up tasks.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Di Blas, N.

Drawing on the distributed cognition theory, the distributed TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge) model (Di Blas et al., 2014) claims that, at least in the latter case, the knowledge required does not reside in just the teacher&rsquo;s head but is rather distributed within a complex system of resources that includes students, colleagues, relatives, experts, the internet, etc. After introducing the distributed interpretation of the TPACK model, this paper focuses on the profile of the teachers who &ldquo;enact&rdquo; it within their classroom, based on data from a large case-study with digital storytelling at school. Results are quite surprising: most of the teachers are quite aged, with more than 20 years of teaching experience, with a background in humanities rather than science; many admit a poor command of Technology Knowledge. Yet, they succeed: benefits for their students are substantial,over a wide spectrum. What lesson can be drawn? That contrary to what may be expected, PK and not TK is probably the issue when introducing technology at school, at least in the case of special projects.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Efilti, E., &amp; Coklar, A.

According to the findings obtained from the present designed in quantitative method, pre-service teachers&rsquo; epistemological belief scores are ranked as learning process-casting doubt on authority/expert knowledge, learning effort, innate/fixed ability, and certainty of knowledge. As for TPACK education competencies, pre-service teachers perceive themselves as advanced level. Another finding is that, gender is not an effective variable in terms of epistemological beliefs and TPACK education competencies among pre-service teachers. For the correlations between TPACK education competencies and epistemological beliefs among pre-service teachers, only learning process and doubt on expert knowledge factors are positively correlated with TPACK competencies at medium level.

The study has covered 61 pre-service teachers attending education faculty of a state university between 2011-2012 academic year. TPACK-deep Scale, ICT Usage Level and ICT Usage Phase surveys have been employed. TPACK competencies which were in medium level prior to taking TPACK-based activities increased to higher level at the end of the process. Furthermore, certain amount of progress was found in the TPACK-deep subdimensions namely design, exertion, ethics and proficiency. At the end of the intervention, it was also determined that ICT usage phase of pre-service teachers increased. Consequently the rise in ICT usage levels of pre-service teachers correspondingly elevated their TPACK competencies. However no significant difference was found between TPACK competencies and gender. Most of the correlations between ICT usage phases and TPACK competency subdimensions were at medium-level significance.

This study examined the design talk conducted by 27 Singapore primary teachers as they worked in teams to integrate student-centered ICT lessons into their school curriculum. Through content analysis and chi-square analyses of about 35 h of coded design talk, it was found that teachers used seven design frames and predominantly considered pedagogical content knowledge, TPACK, and design knowledge when they engaged in ICT lesson design. Teachers consideration of pedagogical content knowledge was driven by design frames related to idea development, perception, enactment, institutional considerations, and interpersonal factors. On the other hand, teachers emphasized idea development and enactment when they considered TPACK. Teachers also had to consider the management of design processes during ICT lesson design.

It was conducted using the survey model because it aimed to determine TPACK of the 995 pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers who participated in the study. They were in the departments of elementary school teaching and preschool teaching at three state universities in the spring term of the 2014-2015 academic year. The study found the means of junior (third year) and senior (fourth year) pre-service teachers in the departments of elementary school teaching and preschool teaching to be high. Their means were also high in the sub-dimensions of TPACK competence. The TPACK means of the pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers were found to be high. The TPACK means of senior pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers were determined to differ from those of junior pre-service preschool teachers. It can be stated that this difference resulted from technology and material development courses taken by the pre-service teachers in different semesters. Their pre-service education had positive effects on their TPACK. Providing pre-service technology education and practice as part of relevant courses will not be adequate. Along with the education, pre-service elementary school and preschool teachers should be provided with opportunities to use technology. These opportunities should go beyond the basis of courses that they take. It should be supplemented with practice in teaching practicum courses and should be included in practice evaluation forms as a criterion.

Study participants were 550 pre-service teachers from three universities in Turkey, Spain and the USA (219, 209, and 122 respectively). The majority of the participants were female. All of the participants were junior and senior students enrolled in elementary teacher education programs.

The results of confirmatory factor analysis in this study supported the construct validity of the scale in all three samples. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative contribution of self-efficacy, outcome expectations and perceived school climate on pre-service teachers&rsquo; intentions to integrate technology into their future classroom activities. The external factor of school climate predicted pre-service teachers&rsquo; intention to integrate technology in education in all three samples. However, there were certain differences among the teachers from different countries in our sample in terms of technology integration. Unlike Turkey and the US, self-efficacy predicted technology integration intention to a smaller degree than school climate in the Spanish sample. Interestingly, outcome expectations scores did not make a statistically significant contribution to predicting pre-service teachers&rsquo; intention to use technology in the US sample.

The TPACK framework which is used as a guide to effective technology integration has not been fully utilized by many who offer professional development or those who design technology courses at teacher preparation programs. Two major problems noted in observation notes are: 1) those who provide professional development do not begin with the background of the TPACK framework; 2) the TPACK framework is usually discussed in isolation of other frameworks such as the UDL framework.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sun, Z., You, J., Song, W., Qu, Z., &amp; Luo L.

The authors conducted an empirical study by investigating mobile-based TPACK, SE, and technology acceptance of more than 500 English teachers from about 220 elementary schools in China, who used Android system-based pad in classrooms for one year. As a result, SE and technology acceptance had indirect positive effects on mobile-based TPACK, while no significant difference was observed in gender for TPACK.

Retrieved from http://uknowledge.uky.edu/edsc_etds/14/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has become an emphasized component of PreK-12 education in the United States. The US is struggling to produce enough science, mathematics, and technology experts to meet its national and global needs, and the mean scores of science and mathematics students are not meeting the expected levels desired by our leaders (Hossain &amp; Robinson, 2011). In an effort to improve achievement scores in mathematics and science, school districts must consider many components that can contribute to the development of a classroom where students are engaged and growing academically. Computer technology (CT) for student use is a popular avenue for school districts to pursue in their goal to attain higher achievement. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of iPads in a one-to-one setting, where every student has his own device 24/7, to determine the effects, if any, on academic achievement in the areas of mathematics and science. This comparison study used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine three middle schools in a private school district. Two of the schools have implemented a one-to-one iPad program with their sixth through eighth grades and the third school uses computers on limited occasions in the classroom and in a computer lab setting. The questions addressed were what effect, if any, do the implementation of a one-to-one iPad program and a teacher&rsquo;s perception of his use of constructivist teaching strategies have on student academic achievement in the mathematics and science middle school classrooms. The research showed that although the program helped promote the use of constructivist activities through the use of technology, the one-to-one iPad initiative had no effect on academic achievement in the middle school mathematics and science classrooms.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Carlson, S.

This research study focuses on one successful middle school&rsquo;s adoption of laptops to support teaching and learning. A qualitative study using interviews of key participants was undertaken with teachers and administrators. The Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework was used in conjunction with Rogers&rsquo; Diffusion of Innovation framework to understand from the participants&rsquo; perspective changes to their practice. The results indicate teachers underwent changes in their use of technology to support teaching and learning, showing increasing overlap between the domains of technological and pedagogical knowledge. The changes resulted in an increase in the transparency of the teaching and learning process for other teachers, students, administrators, and parent. These changes were supported by four school-wide factors; the adoption of a common software suite, robust social networks, modeling by leadership and the professional development model used. The findings were discussed in relation to participants&rsquo; position on the adoption spectrum of Rogers&rsquo; Diffusion of Innovation theory.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gomez, M. (2016).

(UMI No. 10123672)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine what effective teaching with technology looked like in practice within middle grade Social Studies&rsquo; classrooms. An additional purpose was to understand how teachers&rsquo; combine content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge when making decisions about their curriculum. Guiding this study was a conceptual framework that suggests effective teaching with technology comes from technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), a knowledge that is created by combining content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Lakeside Middle School was selected for this study due to both its commitment to technology integration and its implementation of a school wide 1:1 laptop initiative. Three middle grade Social Studies&rsquo; teachers at Lakeside were selected, one each from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms. A multiple case study methodology was used in this study. An observation protocol, designed specifically to capture TPACK moments during observations, was developed. Multiple data sources (interviews, observations, focus group, and artifacts) were collected and analyzed for emerging themes about the TPACK practices of each teacher. Using the data collected, a descriptive case study was written for each teacher. These descriptive case studies identified examples, grouped thematically, of TPACK in practice. These descriptive case studies also recorded each teacher&rsquo;s beliefs about teaching, technology in education, and their own placement within the TPACK framework. Data analysis suggested that that TPACK is developed uniquely in each teacher, shaped by their beliefs and strengths in teaching. Analysis of the data also suggested that the TPACK framework may need to be rethought, in order to fully capture TPACK in practice. Included in this are discussions about how the TPACK framework model fails to account for any of the three teachers&rsquo; TPACK practices, discussions about the model&rsquo;s failure to differentiate between depth and breadth of TPACK knowledge, and discussions about other factors that influence TPACK in practice, including students and teaching environment. The study findings have implications for teacher educators, teachers, and policy makers. Specifically, teacher education courses need to be developed to address the lack of TPACK knowledge that preservice teachers have. Additionally, new professional development sessions are needed for practicing teachers that focus on developing both the depth and breadth of their TPACK practices.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kaaki, W.

There is evidence of low online learner grades in an era of increased use of part-time online faculty. The purpose of this quantitative non-experimental study was to examine the relationship between seven self-reported predictor variables of part-time online faculty working at a private for-profit virtual institution and the criterion variable, online learners&rsquo; grades. A total of 81 out of 148 faculty members participated in the TPACK Survey. Multiple linear regressions and a Pearson r correlation coefficient were used to analyze data. Results of the analyses indicated the seven self-reported predictor variables of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of part-time online instructors did not predict online learners&rsquo; grades. Study findings imply that the domains of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of part-time online instructors do not account for low online learners&rsquo; grades.

The iTEaCH Implementation Model provides focus on teachers&rsquo; choice of technology use, desire for technology use, pedagogy perceptions, and collegiality to identify gaps that might be used to inform teachers and school leaders of technology provision, professional development, and collegial support needs in the school. Using a slightly modified version of the Choy and Ng (2015) data gathering tool (Appendix A) data were collected to investigate the teachers&rsquo; use of technology across three dimensions, namely; types of technology available in the school, teachers&rsquo; pedagogical preferences, and the level of teacher support or collegiality experienced by teachers in the school.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the study intended to investigate the research questions:</p>\n<p>1.

In its</p>\n<p>current national technology plan, Future Ready Learning: Reimagining the Role of Technology in Education, the U.S. Department of Education asserts that educational technologies can transform student learning. Successful integration of educational technology could increase student achievement and transform the setting to bring about positive social change. The purpose of this study was to provide a group of expert panelists an opportunity to identify strategies and guidelines to create an effective educational technology plan. Data were gathered using a modified Delphi technique from 7 teachers, 8 administrators, and 7 policymakers.

Their recommendations confirmed the importance of each stage of Rogers&rsquo; 5 stages of the innovation-decision process; the panelists also reached consensus about the role of the state and its responsibility to provide support and guidance to districts and schools when implementing educational technology plans. The results showed that an individualized approach to implementation of an educational technology innovation, rather than an organizational approach, may improve the rate of diffusion and adoption of educational technology innovations in this state&rsquo;s K-12 public schools.

Creating these authentic learning experiences involves not only ensuring learning will occur, but also connecting the lesson to real world examples. These connections are increasingly made possible in classrooms through the use of mobile technology. Art museums are also taking advantage of digital tools to develop mobile applications that extend interactions with artworks beyond the museum&rsquo;s walls. It is at this intersection of classrooms, mobile technology, and art museums that this study originated. The study focuses on how two elementary educators integrated online art museum resources into their curriculum using mobile technology, and what pertinent implications arise from these experiences that can be applied to developing substantive art museum resources. I prepared myself for the study by reviewing literature concerning constructivism (Hein, 1990), andragogy (Knowles, 1990), mobile technology, technology integration into classrooms, and art museum resources. Working alongside one art specialist and one vii math teacher, I sought to understand each teacher&rsquo;s experience with bringing art museum mobile applications and iPads into their curriculum. It was important to include in the study my voice as a researcher, as well as the voices of the teachers. I, therefore, adopted a narrative approach to reporting the data that enabled our three stories to intersect. The trio of narratives reflect our experiences as I interacted with the teachers as they designed and conducted lessons that utilized museum developed mobile applications of their choice and hosted on iPads. I used the Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Koehler, Mishra, &amp; Cain, 2013) to identify how each teacher&rsquo;s technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge areas interacted during their teaching. Both educators&rsquo; familiarity with, and evolution of, their technological pedagogical knowledge correlated with their perceived success of the lesson. From the teachers&rsquo; experiences, I was better able to identify and understand the importance of collaborating with teachers in research, the unique opportunities for increasing interaction with art museum objects by embracing mobile technology, and the potential for collaborating between universities and art museums in digital projects.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yang, S.-H.

Paper presented at the 11th International Conference on e-Learning, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teacher acceptance is the key for the successful implementation of a new technology in education settings. While the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) offers a well-validated solution in explaining the behavioral intention of adopting an emerging technology, there are research gaps in understanding the determinants of the components in the model. Extending the previous model and applying it in the context of adoption of student response system (a.k.a. clickers), the current study explored the underlying factors that influence the core components of UTAUT&mdash; effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. In particular, the study examined the impact of teachers&rsquo; knowledge on the evaluation of those components. Incorporating the concepts of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), the study attempted to investigate the association of teachers&rsquo; knowledge and the major components in UTAUT. Fifty- two teachers from 7 faculties at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University participated in our teacher survey between May and July 2015. Pearson&rsquo;s correlation analysis reveals that technological knowledge was positively correlated with effort expectancy (p&lt;.01), and behavioral intention (p&gt;.01). Further, there were positive associations between TPACK and performance expectancy (p&gt;.01), as well as behavioral intention (p&gt;.01). Findings supported the hypothesis that teachers&rsquo; knowledge is relevant to the perception on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions.

Nowadays, teachers need diverse knowledge and skills for teaching with ICT and these have been described by Koehler and Mishra (2005) in the TPACK model. According to Koehler and Mishra (2005, 2009) the main components in the TPACK model are content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK) and technological knowledge (TK). TPACK can be seen as a mixture of these components, offering the knowledge needed for supporting students&rsquo; learning of specific content and using ICT in a pedagogically meaningful way (Koehler &amp; Mishra 2005). It is also important to notice that the teachers&acute; TPACK is influenced by contextual factors, such culture, socioeconomic status and the school organization.

However, a divide exists between adoption and effective integration. The presentation outlines the difference between adopting a technology and integrating a technology. The Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) offers a framework that describes the stages of integration. However, CBAM fails to address the pedagogy plays in integration of technology. The TPACK (Technology, Pedagagy, and Content Knowledge) framework addresses the important overlap between pedagogy, teaching and subject matter expertise in integration. TPACK; however, does not address the stages of implementation or suggest the key environment conditions that support adoption. The presentation provides an alternative model that draws upon CBAM and TPACK to describe an adoption timeline and key characteristics of integration. The presentation will address factors influencing successful integration at the individual and institutional levels.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wang, A. Y. (2016, June).

Retrieved from https://www.learntechlib.org/p/173081</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The importance of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) in preparing effective teachers in this technological age has been recognized. Many quantitative TPACK assessments have been developed, but they did not seem to be able to help teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to diagnose the needs for professional development. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present the development of a TPACK assessment in English language arts that better address the needs of EFL teachers in developing their TPACK. In total, 180 teachers participated in the study. Data collected included results of a TPACK survey, interview notes, and observation notes. In this study, the analytical frameworks include the TPACK framework and the Revised Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy. A preliminary TPACK assessment in English language arts was suggested for the EFL teachers to self-evaluate their TPACK needs.

The practices and trends of incorporating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into education, published in the past five years, points to a trend of simply transposing everyday ICT into school processes, without taking into account the necessary pedagogical, technical and conceptual adjustments, nor other factors of the educational complexity. This paper presents an alternative application of an extension to TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge) framework model with CCI (integrated cognitive skills) application for incorporation of technology in the educational process as a way of overcoming these difficulties. The combined application of technological and pedagogical skills in this hybridized model allows the enhancement of learning processes by thinking of education and technology as integrated tools, becoming absolutely vital for better understanding, rethinking and reformulating syllabi, educational policies and practices so as to improve teaching processes.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yasar, O., Veronesi, P., Maliekal, J., Little, L.

Making judicious choices of when, what and how specific tools and pedagogies to use in the teaching of a topic can be improved with the help of curriculum inventories, training, and practices but as new and more capable technologies arrive, such resources and experience do not often transfer to new circumstances. This article presents a case study in which computational modeling and simulation technology (CMST) is used to improve technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of teachers. We report findings of a summer training program for both pre-service and in-service teachers in the Northeastern United States. CMST has shown to be effective on both teaching and learning. Results show that it helps teachers to integrate technology into their teaching in a more permanent, constructive, and tool-independent way. It has also shown to improve student learning in a constructive fashion by first enabling deductive introduction of a topic from a general simplistic framework and then guiding the learner to inductively discover underlying STEM principles through experimentation.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zaritsky, M., Doryoseph, L., &amp; Goodman, A.

Participating teachers took part in one of two iterations of a professional development course focusing on the integration of technology in English teaching. Both iterations were designed based on a cognitive apprenticeship approach and the use of the model of Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as a lens for teachers to implement and evaluate the integration of technology in their own classrooms. The mediating process of reflection has been added to the second iteration in the form of reflective writing. Quantitative analysis of pre-post TPACK questionnaires shows significant improvement of teachers&rsquo; perceptions in the first iteration. Results of the second iteration confirm and extend the findings of the first one.

Rosenberg, Michigan State University</p>\n<p>Focus of the Special Issue<br />Building upon Shulman&rsquo;s (1986; 1987) influential notions of pedagogical content knowledge, or the knowledge needed to teach effectively (and differently) within different curriculum areas, educational technology researchers have embraced technological pedagogical content knowledge, or TPCK/TPACK (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2005; Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; Niess, 2005).<br />TPACK scholarship examines how to develop, apply, and assess this knowledge in diverse education settings and content areas. During the last decade, multiple ways to understand and support its development have emerged, generating approximately 1,000 publications that utilize the construct, impacting the practice of postsecondary faculty, administrators, and others invested in meaningful educational uses of technology.</p>\n<p>Perhaps inevitably, TPACK&rsquo;s enthusiastic reception and rapid dissemination have generated multiple points of divergence which need further study, such as:<br />The specific nature of the knowledge that TPACK describes;<br />How to understand and describe contextual influences upon instructors&rsquo; TPACK;<br />How to measure this knowledge appropriately;<br />How to structure TPACK development in accordance with different adult learners&rsquo; needs.</p>\n<p>Given the widespread diffusion of TPACK, research focusing upon these and related issues will help to determine the direction of future postsecondary learning and teaching with technologies. Therefore, this special issue of AJET will address future directions in TPCK/TPACK research and development.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the TPACK of teachers in Saudi Arabia and USA, and then describe the factors affecting teachers&rsquo; TPACK through an analysis of covariance that incorporates age, teaching experience, and education level as covariates, and the seven levels of TPACK as dependent variables. Differences found between teachers in the US and Saudi Arabia in terms of TPK, and TPCK. The analysis of variance indicated that teachers&rsquo; from the US and Saudi Arabia differ in their perceived TPACK when controlled by years of teaching experience, and educational levels. Teachers in both the US and Saudi Arabia had higher rating of their knowledge in content and pedagogy than technology knowledge. Teachers in Saudi Arabia, however, had higher TK, TCK, TPK and TPCK than teachers in the US.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bueno-Alastuey, M. C., &amp; Esteban, S. G. (2016).

Therefore, TPACK can be defined as a complex interaction between the technology, pedagogy and content. TPACK expresses the overlap between these factors in a two-dimensional space, placing TPACK at the centre. Educators can place their teaching episode within this space and ask, if I place my delivery at this point is it the best point in the TPACK space? Secondly educators may ask how can the best point within the space be determined? The CPT model proposes an attempt to address these questions by recasting TPACK as a three-dimensional pseudo-vector space allowing expected outcomes and observed outcomes to be analysed. For the study presented here our null hypothesis is: H0 = there is no significant difference between the observed and expected outcomes.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gash, H., &amp; McCloughlin, T.

Creativity has becoming increasingly important, as one of the most important and noted skills for success in the 21st century. We offer a definition of creativity; and draw upon a systems model of creativity, to suggest creativity emerges and exists within a system, rather than only at the level of individual processes. We suggest that effective infusion of creativity and technology in education must be considered in a three-fold systemic manner: at the levels of teacher education, assessment and educational policy. We provide research and practical implications with broad recommendations across these three areas, to build discourse around infusion of creative thinking and technology in 21st century educational systems.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hosseini, Z.

Consequently, numerous studies have attempted to describe strategies, models and approaches to develop teachers&rsquo; knowledge for teaching with technology. However, most teachers are still following their traditional teaching methods regarding their cultural, individual and situational conditions. While teaching technology in traditional form and separated from pedagogy and content has already shown its failure in many studies, this study suggests an advanced directed instruction teaching model for preparing teachers for teaching with technology. In this study, directed instruction teaching model offers a step-by-step process to individually guide pre-service teachers how to infuse the appropriate technology for teaching the selected content. Subsequently, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is selected to define and measure technology integration. The result of this study demonstrated that participating teachers learned technology integration in the new directed setting as well as a constructivist setting. In particular, this study pointed out how the suggested directed instructional teaching model could be easily situated in the traditional setting and helped non-constructivist teacher educators in collaborative or individual learning.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hosseini, Z.

Participants were forty-seven pre-service science teachers who were enrolled in the Computer class. The computer attitude scale and the attitude scale toward internet-based learning were used as data sources. The instruments were administrated to the pre-service science teachers at the beginning of the semester as pre-tests and again at the end of the semester as post-tests. Data gathered from pre-and post-administration were analyzed for each of the instruments. The results indicate that such learning experiences have positive effects on pre-service science teachers regarding enhancing more positive attitudes toward computer and internet-based learning and teaching.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Karakaya, F., &amp; Avgin, S.

Scanning method is used for the research. Working group of this research consists of 87 teachers from different institutions and branches. For data collection, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Self&ndash;Confidence Scale (TPACKSC), which is adapted to Turkish from original scale by Graham, Burgoyne, Cantrell, Smith &amp; Harris (2009) and tested for validity and reliability by Timur &amp; Tasar (2011), is preferred. As a result of the study, it is stated that teachers&rsquo; TPACK level is very high. On the other hand, it is seen that self-confidence level of teachers joined to research does not have a statically logical (p&gt;0.05) difference according to their sex, worked institution, joining to a technological education before and they have a statistical logical (p&lt;.05) difference related with the branch, service period, and education level.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kiray, S.

For this reason, the present study aims to develop a TPACK self-efficacy scale for preservice science teachers by following the theoretical framework of technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK), as suggested by Koehler and Mishra (2006). The scale consists of seven subscales, which are technology knowledge (TK), pedagogy knowledge (PK), content knowledge (CK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) with a total of 55 items. A total of 467 preservice science teachers from four different universities in Turkey participated in the study. The Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha reliability coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.969. Following the modification suggestions, confirmatory factor analyses showed that the model fit the scale adequately. The study found significant differences between the bottom and top groups; this shows the sufficiency of the items&rsquo; discriminatory powers. As the result of these analyses, it was found out that the scale had the necessary properties required for measuring the TPACK self-efficacy perceptions of preservice science teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Liu, S.

Of particular focus is the integration of technology into instruction, by using technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) to evaluate professional development. A qualitative research method based on classroom observations and focus group interviews (FGIs) is adopted. Additionally, data obtained from instructional plans, video-recorded classroom observations and FGIs are analyzed using a constant-comparison analysis method. Analysis results indicate that mentor teachers adjust their instruction methods when they receive the support of pre-service teachers specifically by moving from presenting technological content knowledge (TCK) to constructing various TCK bases. The pre-service teachers constantly apply TCK and technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK) to develop professionally, especially in TPACK-related technology integration concepts. Notably, the CPD program benefits pre-service teachers more than mentor teachers because the former actively seek more opportunities to apply TPACK than the latter, who simply exchange digital instructional materials.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Long, T., Cummins, J., &amp; Waugh, M.

Advance online publication. doi:10.1007/s12528-016-9119-8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The flipped classroom model is an instructional model in which students learn basic subject matter knowledge prior to in-class meetings, then come to the classroom for active learning experiences. Previous research has shown that the flipped classroom model can motivate students towards active learning, can improve their higher-order thinking skills, and can improve their collaborative learning skills. However, most current studies focus on students&rsquo; experiences with flipped classroom learning. Because so few studies address the instructor&rsquo;s perspective, and instructors&rsquo; perspectives on technology integration can directly influence their practice of incorporating technology in instruction, this study sought to focus on instructors. This paper is a qualitative case study that reveals instructors&rsquo; experiences and perspectives on using the flipped classroom model in instruction. Structured interviews were conducted with eight faculty members who either previously had used or planned to use the flipped classroom model. Findings include instructors&rsquo; perceived definitions of the flipped classroom, how they improved teaching and learning by using the flipped classroom model, their perceived benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom, and perceived approaches of using it in an effective way. The participants also recommended peer assistance among instructors as valuable support to implement the flipped classroom model in instruction successfully.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lye, S.-Y., Wee, L.-K., Kwek, Y.-C., Abas, S., &amp; Tay, L.-Y.

Despite the popularity and abundance on the internet, our literature review suggested little research has been conducted on the use of simulation in elementary school. Thus, an exploratory pilot case study was conducted to address this research gap. In this study, an open source energy simulation was remixed for use in elementary school targeted at the Grade 4 &amp; 5 students as an after-school enrichment program. We proposed 3 stages: design, customization and implementation, to provide useful insights with the aim to allow other educators to conduct their own remixed simulation lessons. The simulation design principles (e.g., learning outcomes and colour coding) with the corresponding TPACK construct that emerged from the design and customization stages were reported. Such simulation design principles would be useful to interested educators and researchers who wish to adapt and use simulation or teach others how to remix simulation. Data from the multiple sources (e.g., field observations, surveys, design notes and existing simulations) indicated that students enjoyed learning with the remixed energy simulation.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Michalsky, T. &amp; Kramarski, B.

Nevertheless, a gap in the research remains concerning how teachers can bring technology into the classroom. This study focuses on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) framework, which aims to consolidate the multidisciplinary professional knowledge related to technology, pedagogy, and content that teachers need so that they can teach and students can learn effectively using technology tools. Purpose: The goal of the present study was to investigate the value of modification reflection prompts (&ldquo;think ahead&rdquo;) as a complementary reflective framework during the teacher preparatory program, beyond the more traditional judgment reflection prompts (&ldquo;think back&rdquo;). In particular, we examined how preservice science teachers may capitalize on learning from modification prompts versus judgment prompts versus both (&ldquo;think back&rdquo; and &ldquo;think ahead&rdquo;), compared with learning from generic prompts (&ldquo;stop and think&rdquo;) based on the IMPROVE model oriented to TPCK. We examined these four treatments&rsquo; effects on preservice teacher&rsquo; actual design of science lessons and development of their own self-reflection abilities. Participants: Participants were 199 first-year preservice science teachers in their preparatory programs at a university in central Israel. Research Design: We created a quasi-experimental opportunity for four groups of preservice science teachers to systematically contemplate ready-made TPCK-oriented lesson designs. Each used one of four different reflective methods (the independent variable): modification, judgment, combined modification + judgment, or generic prompts. Then we examined the differential contribution of these treatment methods to the two dependent variables: (1) preservice teachers&rsquo; skills for designing actual science lessons and (2) their judgment-type and modification-type self-reflection ability regarding the planning, monitoring, and evaluation phases of their lesson-design process. Data Collection and Analysis: Data were scored by coding schemes and were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up analyses of variance with repeated measures. Findings: Results indicated that preservice teachers who con templated a combination of both judgment and modification reflections in treatment improved more in their lesson-design skills and in their self-reflection ability (of both types at the three phases), compared with preservice teachers who contemplated only a single type of reflective prompt (generic or only judgment or modification). Lasting effects (after a semester without the IMPROVE model, prompts, or TPCK focus) revealed that the combined approach continued to significantly outperform the single approaches. Recommendations: The current study reinterprets the instructional-reflective framework of teacher education programs to include modification reflection too as a means of developing preservice teachers&rsquo; capacity to integrate technology in their lesson designs. &ldquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moore-Adams, B.

The study employed a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative evidence. A paired sample t-Test was conducted on the participants&rsquo; pre- and post-Pathfinder networks. Concurrently, the qualitative evidence was collected from researcher&rsquo;s logbook, participants&rsquo; written documents, and interviews. The participants&rsquo; abilities to design technology-based inquiry activity for science learning were examined via Technology Integration Assessment Rubric (TIAR). The analysis of the Pathfinder networks showed that there were significant developments in the participants&rsquo; knowledge components embodied in TPACK. Nevertheless, the TIAR analysis suggested that the participants&rsquo; designs lacked connecting curriculum goals with technology, and compatibility with curriculum goals and instruction.

Among the contributions of the studies were highlighted research and experimentation supported by TPACK; TPACK as conductor of the initial and permanent education of teachers and the TPACK related with other theoretical models. The model TPACK was considered knowledge base for teaching the integration of technologies in educational contexts, from alignment with pedagogical approaches and teaching specific content. However, some challenges were identified by the studies, such as the difficulty of consensus to define each construct of the model; the need to define the types of technologies embraced by TPACK and fragility in the process of measuring TPACK.

Despite numerous initiatives, not limited to training, workshops and so forth, to bring about sustained and wide‐spread teacher change, transmission/delivery‐based pedagogies and chalk‐and‐talk methods continue to dominate. While policy directives and professional development programmes aim to effect change in teachers&rsquo; practice, they tend to fail to create sustainable change in teachers&rsquo; practice of using emerging technologies (ETs). This paper reports on a study that sought to understand how teachers change their pedagogy of teaching with ETs. Using a Design‐Based Research approach, the paper reports on the teachers&rsquo; pedagogical change framework (Teaching Change Frame ‐TCF) as a diagnostic tool for locating and mapping how teachers&rsquo; change. The TCF maps teachers&rsquo; existing pedagogies and ET uses, and designs a pathway of a change process to affect the desired change. The TCF was tested and refined using data from 325 teachers drawn from rural, resource‐constrained schools, urban, well‐resourced schools and from preservice teaching students in a decontextualized environment. Following three iterations it was found that teachers&rsquo; use of ETs in regulated, restrictive ways correlate with transmission pedagogies, unregulated, dispersed ways correlate with transformative pedagogies. The use of TCF not only located teaching pedagogies but also provide different pathways to ensure sustainable change. Findings emphasize the need for teachers to encourage learners to build/create/construct with ETs and for increased interaction in fostering nonregulated dispersed use of ETs.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Weiss, M.

In this study, 37 in-service teachers enrolled in a master&rsquo;s program in special education were taught to create CAPs for vocabulary terms in a course focused on methods for secondary-level instruction. Teacher-created podcasts were assessed on the presence of Mayer&rsquo;s instructional design principles as well as evidence-based practices for vocabulary instruction. Although teachers were able to include many instructional design principles related to technology in their CAPs, their use of instructional principles and evidence-based practices was inconsistent.

The TPACK that inservice teachers develop is practitioner-based and can be continuously transformed with teaching experiences. In this study, we constructed video-embedded and discipline-focused questionnaires to measure science teachers&rsquo; TPACK. Item sets were generic across four disciplines and designed to investigate teachers&rsquo; TPACK at different levels of the cognitive process. Each questionnaire was embedded with three instructional clips in which preservice teachers demonstrated their previously-prepared lessons on selected topics in biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Through exploratory factor analysis, four factors (i.e., evaluation, evaluation/synthesis, application/analysis, and knowledge/comprehension) emerged from the data. The presumed hierarchical interrelationships among these cognitive processes were investigated through a path analysis. The findings indicated that teachers&rsquo; TPACK at the knowledge/comprehension level made significant loadings to TPACK at higher levels, but this was not the case for application/analysis. The disconnect for application/analysis within the simple-to-complex cognitive process hierarchy suggests that it should be viewed as different from the other three constructs that incorporate more instructional reasoning. The designs for the questionnaire items and embedded instructional clips that were used to elicit practical knowledge and prompt teachers to respond are presented herein.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Zhou, G., Xu, J., &amp; Martinovic, D.

A key goal of this chapter is to illustrate that, although the concepts operate in different paradigms and are designed for a different target audience, they are complementary. The LD construct based on the Learning Design Framework (LD-F) introduced in the Larnaca Declaration is focusing on pedagogical design and is underpinned by the ideas of interdisciplinary, general applicability and flexibility in epistemology and ontology, whereas TPACK is specifically targeted to the education of schoolteachers, providing a framework that illustrates the relationship between the three components of TPACK.

Examples of how technology can become more meaningful in three areas that nurse educators routinely work within are: professional development, teaching, and clinical experiences.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yarnell, L., &amp; Fusco, J.

Specifically, I explored how teachers perceived contextual influences on technology-related instructional decisions in secondary social studies classrooms. I defined teachers&rsquo; contexts as comprised of curricular, interpersonal, and organizational or institutional factors existing on three organizational layers, described as macro, meso, and micro. Through a multiple case study design and interpretivist perspective, I studied three cases of individual social studies teachers working in the shared environment of one high school. I viewed the teachers as curricular-instructional gatekeepers (Thornton, 2005) working in a contested classroom space (Craig, 2009). Through this lens, data generation took place at the classroom level and included interviews, observations, and artifact analysis. Data analysis was structured by the Information Ecologies framework (Nardi &amp; O&rsquo;Day, 1999) to provide a consistent approach for analysis of teachers&rsquo; decision-making within and across cases. Study findings revealed multiple contextual influences that varied in significance across cases depending on the educational orientation of each teacher. Teachers&rsquo; contexts and individual educational orientations aligned to varying degrees and resulted in unique curricular-instructional gatekeeping in each case. Accordingly, instructional decision-making regarding the use of educational technology was inconsistent across cases despite the shared environment in which the three teachers worked.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Campbell, R.

This study was designed to address the problem of lack of effective iPad integration in primary classrooms at an international school in South Korea. The purpose of this case study was to examine primary teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the implementation of an iPad initiative begun in 2012. Framed by Koehler and Mishra&rsquo;s technological pedagogical content knowledge model (TPACK), the study was guided by research questions that involved teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the barriers, challenges, and successes regarding iPad implementation in the primary classroom. A purposeful sample of 5 K-2 teachers who use iPads in the classroom was chosen. The case study design entailed semi-structured interviews, classroom observations of each participant, and examination of teachers&rsquo; lesson plans. Data were coded and analyzed using inductive analysis based on components of a conceptual logic model. Credibility and trustworthiness were ensured through member checking and triangulation of data. Results showed lack of experience, collegial support, and iPad-specific training as barriers and future preparation for teachers as a challenge. Successes were demonstrated through formative assessments and digital portfolios. The resulting project was a comprehensive professional development plan to provide primary teachers with the knowledge and skills to implement technology in the classroom and ongoing support to develop a professional technology learning network. In terms of broad social change, this research and project might provide insight to better prepare educators to make the best use of integrated learning technologies for efficient and effective teaching and learning in classrooms.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Huffman, S.

(UMI No. 10162717)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In spite of initiatives design to address the integration of technology into teaching and the billions of dollars spent to fund these initiatives, there is still a gap in the research on the extent to which teacher education programs prepare preservice teachers to integrate technology into teaching (Kleiner et al, 2007; Abbitt &amp; Klett, 2007). While Schools, Colleges, and Departments of Education are required to address technology integration for accreditation, how and when technology is address is left to the discretion of each institution. Because pre-service secondary education students typically take the majority of their courses outside of the College of Education, teacher preparation programs have a stake in technology use among Arts and Sciences faculty.</p>\n<p>This mixed-methods study used the Higher Education-Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (HE-TPACK) survey to examine perceptions of Arts and Sciences faculty who teach content courses for pre-service secondary education majors at a southeastern research university. The HE-TPACK addressed eight domains of technology training (TT), pedagogy knowledge (PK), technology knowledge (TK), content knowledge (CK), pedagogy content knowledge (PCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), technological content Knowledge (TCK), and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). Interviews were conducted to create a more in depth picture of technology use in the teaching practices of Arts and Sciences faculty. Looking through a theoretical lens of transformative learning, interview participants were asked about their experiences with technology, opportunities they provide for their students to integrate technology through assignments, and any transformative experiences that caused them to view technology in a different way.</p>\n<p>Based on the findings of this study, many faculty overestimate their HE-TPACK abilities. While many faculty still view technology as a production or communication skill, there were specific examples of transformative experiences that changed the way certain individuals address technology for student learning. This agrees with previous research that modeling technology integration helps teachers feel more comfortable and better prepared to teach with technology (Whipp, Schewiezer, &amp; Dooley, 2001; Kayne-Chaplock, Whipp, &amp; Schwiezer 2004). Because of their own transformative experiences, these faculty members were able to facilitate a transformative learning experience for their students (Jang &amp; Chen, 2010).&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jones, J.

The area of Learning Design aims to<br />provide effective, high-quality models to support university teachers in achieving this<br />goal. Research to date on Learning Designs has focused on the development of tools,<br />technical standards, potential needs, and attitudes towards use, with few studies<br />investigating university teachers&rsquo; actual use of Learning Designs. Little is known,<br />therefore, about how teachers apply Learning Designs to real design problems.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this study was to explore how university teachers use Learning Designs<br />as part of their routine design work with real students in naturalistic design contexts<br />throughout a full cycle of planning, implementation, and review. Through rich case<br />accounts and analysis of university teachers&rsquo; work, this study provides new insights into<br />the nature of design work supported by Learning Designs. This research is important because building and developing Learning Designs requires an understanding of their effective integration into the design process.</p>\n<p>A multiple case study approach was used to provide a holistic, rich quote of eight<br />university teachers&rsquo; design work and Learning Designs use for a semester-long<br />undergraduate unit. The study was underpinned by a theoretical framework that<br />conceptualises teachers&rsquo; design work using concepts from design thinking and the<br />Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework to conceptualise teacher<br />knowledge. Data was collected before, during, and after the semester using interviews,<br />documents, stimulated recall, and researcher observations to provide a detailed picture<br />of university teachers&rsquo; work with Learning Designs. Each of the cases was analysed in<br />multiple, iterative phases, resulting in eight rich case descriptions that reveal the key<br />phases of design work and Learning Designs use.</p>\n<p>Additionally, cross-case analyses were conducted to identify key characteristics of<br />design thinking and practice and Learning Designs use across each of the design phases;<br />the relationships between Learning Designs use and key case attributes; and impacts on<br />university teachers&rsquo; design work in the areas of technology, pedagogy, and content. The findings show that the design processes using Learning Designs were student focused,<br />multi-phased, iterative, and ongoing throughout implementation. Participants<br />used Learning Designs in four key ways: to benchmark their pedagogical practice;<br />model and stimulate pedagogical ideas; guide design steps; and document and<br />communicate design plans. Learning Designs acted variously as a framework for<br />thinking and making design thinking visible, particularly for those who created design<br />artefacts using Learning Design ideas and conceptualisations. Learning Design use was also reported to result in a greater awareness of links between the areas of pedagogy,<br />content and technology providing a pattern of evidence supporting pedagogical content<br />knowledge development for designers of new units and technological pedagogical<br />content knowledge development for participants making changes to previously run<br />units.</p>\n<p>The results of this investigation provide new knowledge about university teachers&rsquo;<br />design work using Learning Designs, and their impacts before, during, and after<br />teaching. The outcomes of this research provide evidence that can be used by university<br />administrators, educational designers, university teachers, and Learning Designs tool<br />developers. The complex and ongoing nature of participants&rsquo; design work suggests that<br />university teachers need tools to support design thinking throughout all stages of design<br />work. This includes tools that will allow flexibility and openness for ongoing design<br />work. The findings also point to a deeper role for Learning Designs in the support and<br />development of university teachers&rsquo; design thinking and knowledge integration than has<br />previously been shown.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kennah, M.

This study explores the pedagogical use of ICT in the teaching and the learning process, the impact of its use and the role school principals and the community plays in enhancing ICT in the pedagogy. This is a qualitative case study of two public secondary schools in the South West Region of Cameroon consisting of interviews and observations. A total of 24 participants comprising of 20 teachers, two school principals and two parents responded to semi-structured interview questions. Also, observational study was also carried out to examine the various pedagogical practices of ICT in both schools. All the interview data were all transcribed and interpreted using the participants&rsquo; quotes as examples and evidence of the findings. Pictures were used to analyse observational data whereby moments related to the pedagogic use of ICT in the classroom and other areas in the schools under study were captured and described to strengthen the findings. The TPACK model was used to examine the teacher&rsquo;s knowledge in the pedagogic use of ICT Findings in this study indicated that pedagogic use of ICT is still in its preliminary stages as 16 out of the 20 teachers were passively using ICT in their classroom and an additional two teachers were non-users of ICT in their pedagogic activities.Also, there were no significant changes in the teachers&rsquo; position as a result of the pedagogic use of ICT in the classrooms. 2 out of the 18 teachers who considered themselves as active pedagogic users of ICT were still using the traditional instructional method of teaching even though ICT tools were present in the classrooms. Inadequate ICT training for teachers in their subject area acted as a major challenge for teachers from both schools to integrate ICT in their subject areas. Therefore ICT was still used as an add-on rather than an integrated tool in the teaching and learning process. The majority of the teachers acknowledge positive changes ICT had left in the teaching and learning process. Also, findings from this study reveal that the school principals and parents had little influence over the use of ICT in the pedagogy. It is evident from this study that for teachers to successfully integrate ICT in their classrooms, the teacher pre-service and in-service courses have to technologically drive to ensure effective use of ICT in the pedagogy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Martin, B.

In one Caribbean 4-year college, faculty are expected to prepare preservice teachers to integrate technology in classroom instruction. When preservice teachers are not prepared for technology integration, interventions are necessary to address this challenge of technology integration. The purpose of this qualitative bounded intrinsic case study was to gain an understanding of the process of technology integration by instructors at the research site. Davies&rsquo; theory for understanding technological literacy and the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge model conceptually framed this study. A purposeful sample of 13 instructors who integrated technology in their curricula and volunteered to participate were observed, interviewed, and provided documentation to explore how they integrated technology in their courses. Data were coded typologically using a priori codes and inductively to identify major themes regarding instructors&rsquo; challenges and perceptions of technology integration. Instructors were consistent in their integration of technology, increased technology use when they held a positive view of technology, and did not use sufficient web-based tools. They expressed a need for additional technology integration training, because there is an absence of training opportunities offered in the area of technology integration. Based on these findings, a 3-day technology integration workshop was created for the instructors. These endeavors may contribute to positive social change by empowering instructors to adopt pedagogy that can transform the college classroom environment and can support instructors&rsquo; teaching and learning, thus, preparing preservice teachers to embrace technology in their classrooms.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mart&iacute;nez Buend&iacute;a, J.

The specific objectives are: designing, creating and incorporating didactic materials from enriched e-book following TPACK model; identifying the usefulness of enriched e-book in information processing and digital competence and, finally, assessing whether the enriched e-book improves the informative production in students. The methodological design used is a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest model combining the TPACK model to implement didactic units and activities about Media Education, through the educational use of the e-book EC resource. 53 students have participate from 11 to 12 years old, 11 teachers and 28 families from a public school. The instrument has been the questionnaire to collect information by Likert type with five intervals for 78 items numerically from 0 to 4 distributed in 14 dimensions through which we wanted to collect the assessment of learning level of the three main dimension: level of Media Literacy, level of collaborative learning and the assessment of the digital tool e-book EC. The main conclusions: 1. It has been able to design, to create and to incorporate the e-book EC in an integrative model of Media Education in Primary Education. 2. The e-book EC facilitates collaborative learning based on the creation of knowledge through the interaction and inter-individual, by managing digital resources focused on improving Media Education, which has facilitated the improvement in the autonomous and thoughtful development of students. 3. It is significant starting from low levels, the positive differential average pretest-posttest, of each of the three dimensions covering all its dimensions: Media Literacy 48.43%, 48.56% collaborative learning and evaluation of e-book EC 67.66%, because they show ourselves the absurdity not to develop this disciplinary field as soon as possible. 4.

Improving teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge for teaching Euclidean geometry using integrated information communication technologies software (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from http://scholar.ufs.ac.za:8080/xmlui/handle/11660/4772</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The study aimed at formulating a strategy to improve teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for teaching Euclidean geometry with the aid of integrated information and communication technology (ICT) software. TPACK refers to the interaction of three knowledge domains, which are, technology, pedagogy and content knowledge. The three knowledge domains further intersect to form subsets, which are, technological content knowledge; technological pedagogical knowledge; and pedagogical content knowledge. The three knowledge domains, together with the subsets, were used to define knowledge needed for teaching with the aid of technology. Furthermore, in the context of this study, integrated ICT software tools that were employed in teaching Euclidean geometry as teaching aids were Geometer&rsquo;s Sketchpad, GeoGebra and HeyMath!. The study pursued the challenges that teachers face when they use ICT software as a teaching aid; these challenges included the following: Some teachers experience difficulties keeping up with rapidly advancing software knowledge; and the majority of teachers lack sufficient knowledge and skills to explore the potential of ICT software fully. In addition, part of the problem is that teachers found Euclidean geometry too abstract and difficult to teach. Thus, the study was geared to formulating a strategy to respond to these challenges. However, the challenge is that the knowledge needed for teaching is contextually bound and complex. Thus, the study adopted bricolage as a theoretical lens for the study, mainly due to its critical commitment to making meaning of complex objects of study in their contexts. In this study, bricolage enabled me to consider a theoretical stance from the eight historical moments of qualitative research. Through the multiplicity of theoretical lenses provided by bricolage I was able to unravel the multi-layered challenges and formulate a multi-layered strategy. The multi-layered strategy was made possible by people who came together, with diverse back stories, knowledge and skills. In this study mathematics teachers who are faced with the day-to-day challenges of teaching Euclidean geometry with the aid of ICT software embarked on research to solve their own challenges. Driven by its epistemological stance on knowledge production, participatory action research created a platform for teachers, academics, and a computer programmer to engage in knowledge production activities with equality and tolerance of contrasting views. Various data generation tools were employed, ranging from audio and video recordings, learners&rsquo; scripts and data from their test scores. In order to deepen the meaning of spoken and written text, the study employed Van Dijk&rsquo;s critical discourse analysis at three levels, namely, text, discursive practices and social structures. Furthermore, learners&rsquo; test scores were analysed using statistical techniques, such as boxplot, analysis of variance and statistical modelling. The study analysed the challenges experienced by teachers who teach Euclidean geometry with the aid of integrated ICT software. This was done for the purpose of proposing possible solutions and strategies that can be developed, adopted and adapted to address the challenges teachers experienced effectively. In addition, for the purpose of sustainability of the strategy formulated to improve teachers&rsquo; TPACK during and beyond the duration of the study, the conditions conducive for the strategy were investigated. The study analysed threats and risks that were embedded or inherited in the setting, to prevent them from impeding the successful implementation of the strategy. The study is transformative in nature, which created the opportunity to operationalise and evaluate the success of the strategy prior to it being considered for recommendation. Finally, some of the major findings were that teachers work in silos; and that they do not prepare sufficiently when they use ICT software as a teaching aid.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reichert, M.

The purpose of this study is to describe the pedagogical practices of teachers in a one-to-one iPad initiative in a private school for boys in the Mid-Atlantic region. Specifically, three questions are guiding this work: (1) To what degree are iPads integrated into the teaching and learning processes at Saint Edmond&rsquo;s Academy? (2) How did teachers integrate apps into their instruction, given long-term and unlimited access to iPads?, and (3) What are teachers&rsquo; beliefs with regard to the benefits and drawbacks of using mobile technology in the classroom?</p>\n<p>The study investigates how nine teachers in grades six through eight integrate the technology with their content and pedagogy. Each teacher participated in two rounds of data collection. Data were collected through written lesson plans, classroom observations and teacher interviews.

Lesson plans submitted by the nine teachers were developed using the TPACK lesson plan template. Rubrics based on this framework were used to score lesson plans, classroom observations, and interviews.<br />Findings indicate that teachers in the one-to-one iPad Initiative understand how to plan for lessons that incorporate technology, content and pedagogy. The study also describes how teachers integrate more than eighteen different apps with the content and pedagogy of their lessons, develop students&rsquo; 21st century skills, and use apps to support student flexibility and choice in a lesson. This study also found that teachers believe integrating the iPads enables them to create lessons that provide flexibility and choice, to give students instant access to information, and to allow teachers to take on a different role in the lesson.</p>\n<p>This study provides valuable input that will serve as a resource when drawing further guidelines for continuing, improving or expanding iPad mobile learning initiatives.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4.

While ICT in pedagogy is an undertaking involving stakeholders like teachers, administrators and students, teachers are considered to play a core role in the use of ICT in pedagogy. What factors will then make the teachers use ICT in pedagogy? In deriving the factors affecting the adoption of an innovation, such as ICT in pedagogy, several frameworks are available. Of these frameworks, we review some of the traditional innovation adoption frameworks namely, the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, and the Unified Theory of<br />Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). We find that all the above models have been widely employed in guiding innovation adoption studies. We notably argue that the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework can be included on the list of innovation adoption models. Thirdly, we review past studies on TPACK and isolate pertinent gaps. Hence we develop a framework basing on TPACK, and derive hypotheses to guide further studies on the factors related to the use of ICT in pedagogy by teachers and call for a paradigm shift to have large scale quantitative studies testing whether the TPACK constructs relate to the levels of use of ICT in pedagogy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brill, A.

The increasing use of technology in education to promote effective pedagogy of STEM content has led to the development of the conceptual framework of &ldquo;technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge&rdquo;, also known as TPACK.1 This framework emphasizes teachers&rsquo; use of educational technologies to improve student understanding of content that imposes pedagogical challenges. The TPACK framework is derived from the interactions between three knowledge domains: technology-, pedagogy-, and content-knowledge. In the context of TPACK, technology encompasses technological products and the knowledge, skills, tools, and processes needed to design, build, and operate these products.2,3 Pedagogy refers to principles and techniques of conducting and assessing effective teaching and learning. Finally, content refers to fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and knowledge connections and arrangements useful in classroom environment.4 An intentional application of the TPACK framework can facilitate effective pedagogy through technology integration by making use of the interactions among the three underlying knowledge domains. Thus, for teachers to make effective use of this framework, they require the knowledge of the disciplinary content, as well as an understanding of the educational technology and its practical applications in education.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deere, R., Borukhovich, Y., &amp; Wright, K.

It&rsquo;s useful as a tool for discussion, self-assessment, and growth; but like any model it doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. Two recent experiences in my AP US History class highlight this for me:<br />&bull; In one lesson, after discussing westward migration in the antebellum United States, students played the classic Oregon Trail video game. We ended by talking about the many risks of the westward journey and evaluating how accurately the game portrayed them. It was a lot of fun and a fairly successful mix of technology, content, and pedagogy.<br />&bull; A few days earlier, as a review of antebellum society, students stepped into character for a &ldquo;speed dating&rdquo; activity. They held short conversations with other characters from the era and judged who would be their most likely friends among the group.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>6.

Each element of TPACK model was used as a guide in the development of teaching plan for blended learning environment. A randomized pretest and posttest quasi-experimental research design was used in this experiment to determine the significant difference on the posttest sores of the experimental and control group in terms of their achievement test in Computer Fundamentals. Participants of the study consisted 90 freshmen Bachelor of Science in Information Technology students, 45 students each comprising the experimental and control group. An item-analyzed multiple-choice achievement test floated before and after the experiment. Result revealed successful integration of technology in a technology-deprived university using TPACK model for BLE. In terms of student learning, results revealed that both the experimental and control group slightly increased their mean score using the blended learning approach and traditional teaching inside the classroom which concludes that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control group after the TPACK experiment as compared to the control group exposed to the traditional approach of teaching, hence it is recommended to continuously focus on PCK to further improve the TPACK model for BLE for school in rural areas.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Akmal, A.

However, in reality the condition of teenagers today is very alarming. The data show about 93 out of 100 elementary school students have already consumed pornography; about 21 out of 100 young women have abortions; some 135 teenagers become victims of violence every day; 5 out of 100 adolescents contract sexually transmitted diseases; 63 out of 100 teens have sex before marriage. School teachers should take active roles in minimizing such unhappy figure and prepare the golden generation. This article proposes local culture and local moral to complete the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK+) within the challenge of the 21st century skills. The objectives are to provide pre-service English Teachers at Universitas PGRI Semarang and pre-service English teachers in general with the ability to develop English course content in the students&rsquo; cultural context as well as local characters and to equip the pre-service teachers with the 21st century skills. The subjects were 345 pre-service English Teachers who took the TEFL, Teaching Media, and ESP Courses during the academic year of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. The data were collected through observation, teaching practice, and self-evaluation. The results show 84.92% of the students were included under the category of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;very good&rdquo; in pedagogical skills, 77.38 % in pedagogical content knowledge, and 87.53 % in cultural and local wisdom context in content development, but only 51.58% in technological knowledge. For improving technological knowledge of the pre-service students, there should be more training on the use of technology before and during the process of teaching and learning of pre-service English teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Batiibwe, M.

While ICT in pedagogy is an undertaking involving stakeholders like teachers, administrators and students, teachers are considered to play a core role in the use of ICT in pedagogy. What factors will then make the teachers use ICT in pedagogy? In deriving the factors affecting the adoption of an innovation, such as ICT in pedagogy, several frameworks are available. Of these frameworks, we review some of the traditional innovation adoption frameworks namely, the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Technology-Organization Environment (TOE) framework, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). We find that all the above models have been widely employed in guiding innovation adoption studies. We notably argue that the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework can be included on the list of innovation adoption models. Thirdly, we review past studies on TPACK and isolate pertinent gaps. Hence we develop a framework basing on TPACK, and derive hypotheses to guide further studies on the factors related to the use of ICT in pedagogy by teachers and call for a paradigm shift to have large scale quantitative studies testing whether the TPACK constructs relate to the levels of use of ICT in pedagogy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Batiibwe, M.

The use of ICT in pedagogy opens up opportunities for learning because it enables learners to access, extend, transform and share ideas and information in multi-modal communication styles and formats. Therefore, all efforts to enhance it should be expended. One way of enhancing the use of ICT in pedagogy is to isolate the factors that underpin it. It is with this understanding that, basing on the Technological, Pedagogical, and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, this paper proposes a positivist study to examine the extent to which knowledge relates with the use of ICT in pedagogy among teachers of mathematical disciplines at Makerere University.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cabus, S.

Therefore, this paper evaluates the use of SMARTboard in class, in combination with teacher training, using a randomized field experiment among 199 pre-vocational students in seventh grade in the Netherlands. During 6 weeks, students in the intervention group participated in math classes in which the SMARTboard was used to apply level differentiation. The teachers of these classes received a specific training (Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge [TPACK]) in using the SMARTboard in class. Control classes were taught by teachers without the training, who did not use the SMARTboard in class. The results showed that level differentiation in class, which was possible because of the efficient use of the SMARTboard, significantly increased math proficiency with 0.25 points.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can, S., Dogru, S., &amp; Bayir, G.

This study examined the extent master&rsquo;s degree students in the field of educational technology demonstrated their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) related elements in their e-portfolio reflection, when they were guided by TPACK framework grounded instruction. Using content analysis technique and open-ended survey responses, the findings show that graduate students were able to demonstrate their interconnected technological pedagogical knowledge in their reflection to justify their competencies. In addition, graduate students had positive reactions to the opportunity to reflect through writing the reflection paper. This study contributes to the eportfolio literature by signifying the importance of providing a discipline-specific framework to guide students&rsquo; reflection of learning. The TPACK grounded instruction helped graduate students stay focused on their reflection.

The need to know how teachers integrate technology in instruction has brought about different views. Therefore, this study mainly seeks to understand these views on lecturers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) perceptions, as it examines how their views differ according to gender, employment status, department and the state of in-service training oriented towards the use of technology. In order to achieve the above stated aim, the researcher statistically examined Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU) Faculty of Education lecturers&rsquo; TPACK perceptions. In this research, a TPACK survey instrument was administered to 53 lecturers, and a questionnaire was used to ascertain their perception levels across the seven TPACK dimensions. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, frequency and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test) were used for data analysis. The study reveals that lecturers&rsquo; perceptions of TPACK were significantly high across all knowledge dimensions and there were statistically significant differences on how lecturers viewed TPACK according to the above listed variables. These differences occurred in Technological Knowledge (TK) and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) according to gender; Technological Knowledge (TK) and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK) according to employment status; Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) according to department, and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) according to in-service training.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&Ccedil;oklar, A.

Rogers is classified individuals in five different categories (innovators, early adaptors, early majority, late majority, laggards) in terms of their innovation characteristics and states them as individual innovativeness. Having an individual innovativeness level is a factor which not only may influence people&rsquo;s skills concerning use of technology but also may influence teachers&rsquo; technological integration level in the class. This study aims to determine the effect of teachers&rsquo; individual innovativeness level on technological integration process. In line with this purpose, TPACK self-efficacies scale and individual innovativeness scale have been applied to 421 teachers employed in Turkey in 2013-2014 education years. Teachers&rsquo; individual innovativeness levels, TPACK skill conditions and predictive power level of individual innovativeness on TPACK skills have been researched. As a result of this research, it has been understood that a great majority of teachers consider themselves as early majority and early adaptors as well as being advanced level in terms of TPACK skills. In addition it has been concluded that there is a positive and important relationship between individual innovativeness and TPACK, while individual innovativeness becomes an important predictor of TPACK skills.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Farah, M., Ireson, G., &amp; Richards, R.

Therefore, TPACK can be defined as a complex interaction between the technology, pedagogy and content. TPACK expresses the overlap between these factors in a two dimensional space, placing TPACK at the centre. Educators can place their teaching episode within this space and ask, if I place my delivery at this point is it the best point in the TPACK space? Secondly educators may ask how can the best point within the space be determined? The CPT model proposes an attempt to address these questions by recasting TPACK as a three dimensional pseudo-vector space allowing expected outcomes and observed outcomes to be analysed.

Both t-tests and ANOVA analyses were used to examine the differences due to their demographic backgrounds. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the predicting variables of the teachers&rsquo; GPCK. The results showed that, among the factors of GTBS and TPACK-G, GPK plays the most critical role in predicting GPCK. In addition, the elementary school teachers had h5er Belief, Confidence and Motivation for using game-based teaching approaches, and had higher GPK and GPCK than middle school teachers. A gender difference only existed in GK. Younger teachers had better GK and GCK than older teachers.

Abstract retrieved from http://learntechlib.org/p/173346</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Despite the growing popularity of digital teaching portfolios, research has remained focused on outcomes associated with making digital teaching portfolios instead of examining the ways in which they can effectively assess what teachers know, especially when it comes to educational technology. One barrier to using portfolios as a means of assessing teachers&rsquo; knowledge of technology is the lack of a guiding framework for characterizing teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge. In this paper, we propose that the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework is well-suited to study the knowledge (including technological knowledge) teachers represent in their digital teaching portfolios. We exemplify how the TPACK framework can guide a content analysis of digital teaching portfolios by analyzing 589 online portfolios created by teachers as the culminating assessment in their master&rsquo;s studies. We conclude that the TPACK framework is helpful for analyzing the types of technological knowledge teachers may represent in portfolios but also acknowledge several important challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lefebvre, S., Samson, G., Gareau, A., &amp; Brouillette, N.

Thus, the diffusion of distance education concept among educators and use of related technologies in many campuses has been growing. Although different advanced technologies are available for preparing and delivering content online, the important question on how to use these technologies still remains unanswered. Literature on the subject recommends that having access to technology itself does not produce desired outcome, unless it is supported with appropriate pedagogical approaches. This study, therefore, was designed to investigate pedagogy of teaching and learning online from adult students&rsquo; perspectives. Specifically, to understand pedagogical factors that impact student understanding of the content online, how adult students in an online program assess pedagogical approaches represented by course instructors, weaknesses they have experienced and ideas what would be done in terms of pedagogical approach so that adult learners learn better in online environments. Participants stressed on the importance of pedagogical planning and implementation strategies. Among those issues, planning before teaching, social presence through interactions, and feedback mechanism are mostly indicated issues necessary for effective teaching and learning online.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Resbiantoro, G.

Forty six pre-service English language teachers were selected purposively from a local university and a teacher training college, based on these few criteria set within the limitations of this study. This atudy adopted and adapted the questionnaires from the ICT Integration Survey (Spazak, 2010) and Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) by Mishra and Koehler (2006). These questionnaires are adopted for the purpose of understanding the pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological skills, as well as their content and pedagogical knowledge of English language teaching at the point in time when the data was collected. The data collected were analysed using the Statistical Packet for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that pre-service English language teachers are confident users of ICT, both for their own personal interests and to integrate ICT in their teaching. However, it is also found that pre-service teachers are skilled in ICT because they have been exposed to it since young. Further results that have emerged from this study revealed that there is no relationship between the time used in ICT and the confidence or skills in using ICT.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yigit, N., Alev, N., Yurt, &Ouml;., &amp; Mazlum, E.

The paper also investigates the extent to which the teachers employ technology to accomplish pedagogical goals as well as the instructional methodology they embrace when they use ICT in the classroom. The thrust of the argument in the current study is that the way practicing teachers use educational technology is reflective of the inadequacy of the pre-service training programs that still insist on disentangling ICT from pedagogy and content. Informed by TPACK, a four-section, five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to 56 ELT practitioners in middle and secondary education in the province of El-Jadida. It was found that the integration of technology, pedagogy and content was left to the discretion of the teachers. This approach resulted in limited ICT implementation for instructional purposes and inconsistent interpretations of how ICT can best be used in the classroom. Although the teachers reported that they embraced a student-centered methodology while using ICT, they also fell back on teacher-centered instructional principles. On the basis of the results obtained, a number of implications will be offered for an effective ICT-oriented ELT teacher education.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Chapters</em></p>\n<p>Dragnic-Cindric, D., Barrow, E., &amp; Anderson, J.

Phase I of this mixed-methods study employed the use of a survey with upper elementary school teachers in a large urban school district in South Florida to establish an understanding of strategies elementary school teachers apply in overcoming intrinsic and extrinsic barriers while exploring their beliefs, attitudes and concerns about adopting technology for instructional purposes. Using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) theoretical framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), this study explored the types of barriers most obstructive in teachers&rsquo; efforts to implement technology and identified strategies applied by teachers effectively using technology. Survey participants self-identified as high or low users of technology and analyses revealed a significant difference in their attitudes, values and beliefs and their use of strategies in overcoming barriers in technology use. No significant difference was found in the extrinsic barriers to technology use which must be addressed. Phase II of the study included three focus groups from the same sample group, exploring the phenomena of adopting technology.

Using a mixed method study design, the researcher surveyed colleagues about their iPad use in the classroom, their experience with iPad integration and professional development training effectiveness. The researcher examined how students and teachers were using technology in the classroom and how professional development could assist educators in the integration of educational technology into the classroom. Educational technology was found to be linked to student achievement, in turn improving student retention of learned materials. Teachers were found to understand the importance and necessity of technology in the classroom, yet some digital immigrant teachers were resistant to full integration of technology for a number of reasons. The study revealed that professional development could improve the integration of technology, but ongoing support for the integration of technology into the classroom is lacking. The researcher found that the faculty and students would benefit from the introduction of an educational technology library, along with an Educational Technologist who could assist teachers in bridging the digital divide between themselves and their digital native students.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Irish, S.

This study examined what a generation of teachers has over time identified as best applications of using these devices; their benefits, drawbacks, and challenges; and whether their use reflected previously identified best application of technologies in the classroom. This case study, conducted in one school system in New England, used the theories of Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition (SAMR) and Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Analysis (TPACK) as a conceptual framework. Participants included two groups, one composed of four teachers who have taught only after implementation of one-on-one laptop use and one composed of four teachers who taught both before and after device implementation, selected to determine whether differences existed in attitudes and practices based on types of teaching experience. Data sources included interviews and observations. Results indicated both veteran and established teachers embraced the use of one-to-one devices in their teaching, but both groups lacked the knowledge of SAMR and TPACK theories to best apply them in the classroom. This study contributes to the field by including recommendations for h5er teacher technology implementation, including more in-depth training and support with application of TPACK and SAMR theories in classroom pedagogy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kim, S.

Based on the theoretical framework on teacher beliefs and Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (TPACK), I investigated four preservice secondary mathematics teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) and their beliefs about the nature of mathematics, learning and teaching mathematics, and the use of technology in the mathematics classroom. Three semi-structured interviews (beliefs, task-based, and performance interviews) were used to collect data about the preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK components, beliefs, and how to use a technology tool in their imaginary mathematics teaching. The findings of this study indicated that preservice teachers with sophisticated or student-centered beliefs about the nature of mathematics, learning mathematics, and technology use displayed higher levels of mathematical content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and technological content knowledge, respectively, than preservice teachers with traditional or teacher-centered beliefs about mathematics, learning mathematics, and technology use. In addition, this study suggested that in order to effectively use technology to teach mathematics, preservice teachers should develop their beliefs and knowledge in all areas of mathematics, pedagogy, and technology. Understanding the relationships between preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK and beliefs provides insights into how teacher education programs can support preservice teachers to develop TPACK and integrate technology into their future mathematics instruction.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mukhari, S.

As a result, ICT usage is gaining momentum in world schooling systems. Cognisant of the benefits of ICTs in teaching and learning, South African schools have introduced ICTs in schools and teachers are compelled to adopt and integrate technology to improve their pedagogic activities. The purpose of this research was to explore South African teachers&rsquo; experience in using ICT in the schooling system. This study was underpinned by the Network Society theoretical framework that endorses the use of ICTs in teaching and learning environments. The research method used in the study followed a qualitative interpretative approach and data collection methods included a literature study, non-participant observation and semi-structured interviews with a purposefully selected sample of teachers and school principals and analysis of documents on ICTs in teaching and learning. Findings indicated that ICT integration in teaching and learning is endorsed by teachers and principals who understand the benefits of ICT in enabling better methodological strategies, greater collaboration among teachers, improved access to the required information and the ability to cater for learners with different potential and learning styles. However, a number of factors that hinder the successful ICT integration in urban schools were identified as inadequate ICT infrastructure, teachers&rsquo; lack of ICT skills and low level of ICT proficiency, inadequate training, negative attitudes and poor teacher confidence. Other factors included lack of ICT leadership, funds and technical support. These findings indicated poor implementation of policy and a lack of connection between theory and practice. It was concluded that all education stakeholders, including parents, should work together in securing an ICT infrastructure that will accommodate all learners. It was recommended that more regular workshops which focus on the development of ICT skills in accordance with the proficiency levels required to effect successful integration of ICTs by teachers, be conducted. Moreover, principals should attend training workshops to learn about their responsibilities as ICT leaders at school. Technological pedagogical and content knowledge (PACK) together with CRAR3FS2 principles could provide a crucial framework for training South African teachers to overcome their ICT skill challenges. The ultimate goal of this study is to analyse factors that both hinder and enable the integration of ICTs into teaching practice in South Africa and to contribute to the body of literature on ICT integration in South African urban schools.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Piotrowski, A.

The participants were preservice English teachers taking an online English education course during Summer 2015. The researcher used a survey to purposefully select nine individuals with a range of self-reported knowledge. Participants were then interviewed twice, had their course assignments collected and analyzed, and submitted three written reflections. The course that the participants took challenged preservice teachers to bring together their content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge to create flipped lessons videos and a series of lesson plans. The data showed that there was no pattern or stages of TPACK development. Participants saw potential for flipped learning to be useful in secondary English classes and that while participants wanted to use technology and teach digital literacies in their future classrooms, they also wanted their students to engage in traditional print literacy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Singer, J.

President Obama&rsquo;s Affordability Proposal reported on a college &ldquo;cost crisis&rdquo; created &ldquo;by failing to use technology to its fullest effect&rdquo; (Kelly and Carey, 2013). The non-profit Alliance for Excellence in Education, in 2006, reported that community colleges alone spent $1.4 billion per year on remedial courses for recent high school graduates (Smydo, 2008). This quantitative study reports on the perceptions of NYS community college math faculty on the effectiveness of a math MOOC as a remediation strategy, use in remedial courses and as free online educational resource for the math college placement exam. After levels of Technology Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK), faculty MOOC Awareness (MA) and perceived Barriers to Technology Integration (BTI) were measured, faculty reviewed a sample math MOOC syllabus with a delivery system containing instructional videos, self-assessments and a dashboard of student math competencies and reported on Math MOOC Remediation Effectiveness (MMRE) and Faculty Interest in teaching with MOOC Remediation (FIMR). Faculty expressed their willingness to collaborate in MOOC creation. The electronic survey was juried and factor analyzed for content and construct validity. Results showed that community college math faculty had low familiarity with MOOCs as a remediation strategy. However after viewing a video intervention showing a free sample MOOC with tutorials, platform faculty perceived that Math MOOC Remediation may be an effective educational strategy to increase passing rates on math competency entrance tests and to increase passing rates in college remedial math courses. Significant differences were found within this study. Significant positional differences indicated that adjunct math faculty had greater interest in teaching a future math remedial course if a remedial math MOOC was aligned to the college syllabus. Full-time math faculty was more aware of MOOCs as an educational strategy. This study found an inverse significant correlation which indicated that that older faculty with greater years of college teaching tended to have less interest in teaching with MOOC Remediation. Significant gender differences were found indicating that males teach more online courses than females.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sullivan, D. D. (2016).

Regarding the Faculty, the study collected a number of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, discipline, academic background and experience in online teaching. Results show the limited use of technology in classroom, highlighting only those technologies related with graphic and dynamic presentations, while they do show correlation between the use of LMS tools and SM tools. However, significant differences in the use of technology in the classroom have been found between teachers from different disciplines, academic backgrounds and prior experience with online teaching, while no differences were detected in other variables. This investigation thus contributes to studies that aim to advance the effective integration of technology in teaching and learning by introducing relevant teacher variables.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Karunanayaka, S.

Early childhood education (ECE) will be defined as education from birth to age eight although this study focused primarily on educators for preschool age group that is from age three to five. The targeted participants included four preschool teachers with varying technological skills and knowledge. Methods of data collection were pre-survey, post-survey, follow-up survey, group interviews, follow-up interviews, classroom observations, and documentation of iPad workshops and other email correspondences. The data included existing data from a grant project completed at the end of 2013 and new data from follow-up interviews collected in May 2014. The data were analyzed using coding methods in two cycles. The three major findings were 1) the exploration of affordances provided by iPads showed common themes of efficiency and effectiveness in assessing, teaching, and learning. In addition, there were some affordances particular to teaching and learning; 2) the exploration in how participating teachers discovered the affordances of iPad over time indicated parallel progression in technological knowledge and change in their value system about the affordances of iPad; and 3) the exploration in the progression of technological knowledge and change in their value system about the affordances of iPad within the TPACK framework suggested that there was a close relationship between progression of technological knowledge (TK) towards TPACK and progression of affective-valuing (AV) towards affective-characterization by value system (AC).&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Peng, C.A, Soon, V.

A total of 609 final year student teachers who are trained in five different subject areas (elementary teaching, social science teaching, science teaching, mathematics, and Turkish Teaching) of an education faculty participated in the study. The study was carried out in the spring semester of the 2014-2015 academic year. An adapted Turkish version of the TPACK Scale was used as the data collection instrument. The data was analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software. An independent t-test, ANOVA, Mann Whitney-U, and Kruskal Wallis Tests for non-parametric data were used for statistical analysis. The results show, in the current state, participants have good levels of TPACK. It is also found that there are meaningful relationships and significant differences between some variables such as gender, program attended, having a personal computer and Internet connection, and sub-factors of the TPACK scale. It is suggested that more practical opportunities should be facilitated for pre-service teachers at education faculties to prepare them for 21st century schools.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anderson, S., Grifith, R., &amp; Crawford.

The methods used in the study was descriptive. Nineteen pre-service science teachers (PSTs) of an educational university in Indonesia were involved in a semester long school science course. The course mainly develop students&rsquo; pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by utilizing content representation (CoRe) template. Furthermore an infusion of technological knowledge (TK) analysis led to the study of their TPACK by extending the template with a question in line to TK. The extended CoRe and self-reported survey were employed as instruments. The analysis of data used were quantitative and qualitative technique to obtain the insight into PSTs&rsquo; PCK and TK. The results shows contrary value of PCK and TK identified by CoRe template to those measured by self-reported survey. However, the PSTs perceive their TPACK much higher, that, is 74.74%. Further investigation regarding PSTs ability to compose lesson plan was recommended for further research to capture more comprehensive insight into PSTs&rsquo; TPACK.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Avidov-Ungar, O., &amp; Shamir-Inbal, T.

Retrieved from http://www.informingscience.org/Publications/3699</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract:<br />&ldquo;Aim/Purpose The aim of the study is to examine what ICT coordinators perceive as the main elements of knowledge needed to implement ICT successfully into school culture.<br />Background For the past few years, Israel&rsquo;s Ministry of Education has been running a national program of adapting the education system to the 21st century skills. Key teachers have been appointed as ICT coordinators. Their role was to implement technology in schools. Methodology The participants in this study were 130 ICT coordinators in Israeli Hebrew and Arabic schools. Those ICT coordinators had to attend a special in-service 60- hour course throughout an entire school year. The research tool was the reflection of the ICT coordinators who were asked to complete at the end of the inservice course. Narrative analysis was chosen as the main approach to data analysis.<br />Contribution We claim that ICT coordinators maintain a complex perception of their role, based on broad personal and professional knowledge that enables them to lead the needed changes. Findings Based on the findings the coordinators revealed primary successful elements of their work: (a) technological aspects, (b) pedagogical aspects, (c) the organizational aspects, and (d) the ICT coordinator as a leader of systemic change. The first two elements already appear in the TPACK construct, while the others constitute organizational knowledge (OK) and leadership knowledge (LK) that enables the coordinators to facilitate ICT implementation in schools, and these are the unique elements of this study.<br />Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend that when choosing ICT coordinators or ICT implementation leaders at school, one should check not only that they possess the familiar TPACK knowledge, but also organizational knowledge and leadership knowledge that was found essential to successful completion of the coordinators&rsquo; role.<br />Impact on Society This study has shed light on the nature and significance of leadership knowledge (LK) and its function as an additional expression of TPACK.<br />Future Research We suggest that future research about educational technology leaders&rsquo; TPACK be drawn from these results.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Baturay, M., Gokcearslan, S., &amp; Sahin, S.

There were 280 participants in the study. The results of the study indicate that teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards CAE scores are much higher than their TPACK scores. There is a low level positive correlation between their TPACK competencies and their attitudes towards CAE. Particularly, teachers&rsquo; competencies of Technology Knowledge (TK) and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK) have much higher relationship with their attitude towards CAE when compared to other competencies. Attitude toward CAE is observed to differ by gender. As for TPACK competencies, TK and Technological Content Knowledge (TCK) differ by gender. The TPACK framework explains 20% of attitudes towards CAE. TK is the construct having the highest effect in explaining the attitude towards using CAE.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bibi, S., &amp; Khan, S. H. (2017).

Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33(4), 70-87. doi:10.14742/ajet.3071</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this paper, we discuss how a university lecturer (pseudonym: James) drew on his technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) when planning to integrate technology in teaching. The main purpose of the study was to use real-life planning observations to understand James&rsquo;s TPACK. The data were obtained through think-aloud sessions in which James planned a course that is offered to undergraduate initial teacher education (ITE) students in a research-intensive Australian university. Chi&rsquo;s (1997) verbal analysis method was used to analyse verbal qualitative data. The results indicate that a different set of knowledge domains underpinned James&rsquo;s decisions in each different episode of his planning sessions giving his TPACK a dynamic and context-sensitive nature. We suggest observations of teachers when making actual planning decisions as one of the preferred methods to understand the nature of their TPACK. The study introduces a new approach in understanding how this teacher&rsquo;s TPACK looks when he drew on various domains of knowledge, by visually presenting the combinations made among knowledge domains.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bustamante, C.

This study analyzes the perceptions of 744 undergraduate students regarding their TPACK levels measured by responses to a survey developed by Sahin (2011). The survey contains seven subscales: Technology knowledge (TK), pedagogy knowledge (PK), content knowledge (CK), technological pedagogy knowledge (TPK), technological content knowledge (TCK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK). These seven subscales form the seven variables of the study. The findings show that teacher candidates with more technology knowledge will have more knowledge in pedagogy and content. Also, pedagogy seems as the only variable that is significantly related to all of the variables presented in the TPACK model. This result suggests that pedagogy is the core knowledge of the TPACK. In the study, technology and content knowledge domains influence the TPACK indirectly. Moreover, only the dyadic knowledge components including the content knowledge are related the TPACK.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chaemchoy, S. (2017).

This study explored the relationship between pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention to use technology to teach mathematics and their TPACK. A case-study analysis was conducted to determine whether six pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention to use technology in their classroom delivery was associated with a predominance of TPACK (the TPACK model component) in their choice of technology-supported mathematical tasks. The findings showed a considerable disconnect between pre-service teachers&rsquo; behavioural intention and their technological pedagogical content knowledge. Even where they expressed favourable intentions, the type of knowledge they called into play when selecting technology-supported tasks was unrelated to TPACK and did not suffice to identify the educational potential of technology. An emphasis on TPACK, in conjunction with the development of favourable attitudes toward the use of technology, is therefore believed to be indispensable in pre-service teacher education programmes.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Graziano, K.

The study group of this research consists of 96 teachers in total having different variations such as different branches, different professional seniorities, different ages and different educational levels they work in. Data collection tools comprising of 3 open-ended questions which are developed and structured by researchers and two different scales measuring technology acceptance and usage and web pedagogical content knowledge are utilized in this study. The scales and structured forms are applied through random sampling with screening model. In the results of the research, teachers&rsquo; technology acceptance and usage situations, web pedagogical content knowledge situations and their sexes and web 2.0 technologies usage situations don&rsquo;t differ in terms of the dimensions and the entirety of the scales. The following are established according to the results; there are differences among teachers&rsquo; TAU situations, there aren&rsquo;t any differences among their WPACK in terms of their branches; there aren&rsquo;t any differences among their TAU situations and there are differences among their WPACK situations in terms of their ages; TAU and WPACK situations are not reasonable statistically in terms of their professional seniorities and educational levels they work in. Furthermore, it is also determined that web applications usage durations are not reasonable in terms of their TAU situations but they are reasonable in terms of WPACK. The answers which teachers provided towards open-ended questions are established to be categorized as education, technology, interaction, visuality, source and development. Additionally, it is settled that there is a low correlation between TAU and WPACK situations but it is possible to form a model between them. From the point of view of the findings of this study, it is suggested that knowledge and information regarding technology integration is provided experimentally to teachers in in-service seminars.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Limbong, E.

However, to fully exploit the potential of educational technologies, teachers must have specific knowledge and skills. This study aimed to articulate the technological pedagogical content knowledge teachers need to make effective use of technology for early literacy. Through three rounds of expert consultation using a Delphi study approach, key priorities for the education of lower primary school teachers, especially those teaching kindergarten, were articulated. The results of the Delphi study show expert consensus on the importance of educating pre-service teachers about: electronic books and educative television; explicit goals and task-focused instructions using specific tools; how to shape technology-rich classroom interactions; and how to integrate computer activities in language teaching. Experts stress the importance of developing age-appropriate teaching skills and critical consideration of the value of technologies for specific learning goals. When this critical stance is lacking (e.g., using technology for entertainment, or substitution of existing activities), they recommend against technology use in kindergarten. These findings can help teacher education programs offer pre-service teachers adequate opportunities to develop the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge needed for effectively using technology in the domain of early literacy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mei, B., Brown, G.

This study aims to remedy this situation through the identification of factors influencing preservice EFL teachers&rsquo; intention to adopt Web 2.0 technologies for language learning purposes in the PRC. Based on the technology acceptance model and the technological pedagogical content knowledge model, a hypothesized seven-factor model was tested via structural equation modeling with data obtained from 295 preservice EFL teachers in the PRC. The results revealed that intention to use CALL 2.0 was predicted most h5ly by facilitating conditions. This finding can help stakeholders to make informed decisions about various aspects of facilitating conditions to effectively enhance preservice EFL teachers&rsquo; acceptance of CALL 2.0 in the PRC.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Norton, M., Creghan, C., Creghan, K.

Technology is being purchased and put into classrooms at an alarming rate. While the impact on learning has not reached its potential; educators need to explore how we go about integrating technology so that it positively impacts educational processes and learning outcomes. This research study explored both teacher and administrator perceptions of technology integration and professional development with the intent of finding ways administrators can support teachers with integrating technology in the classroom in order to impact learning. Teachers and administrators in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston were surveyed and their responses were used to develop a second survey. This survey was given to a focus group of teachers at Christ the Redeemer Catholic School in Houston, Texas. The study revealed differences between: how administrators and teachers define technology integration; ways in which teachers want to learn about technology integration; ways in which administrators plan on presenting that information; and between what teachers want to learn about technology integration and what administrators are teaching during technology-related professional development.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Padmavathi, M.

This framework originates from the opinion that use of technology in educational context would be effective only if content, pedagogy and technology are aligned carefully. It implies that for teachers to use technology in their teaching, they need to be competent in all three domains. This present paper is an attempt to understand the assumptions and components of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as a conceptual framework. Further, the paper addresses the issues and challenges in preparing teachers with TPACK capabilities, apart from emphasizing the role of teacher educators, pre-service, and in-service teachers in understanding TPACK for effective classroom teaching and learning. Suggestions for developing TPACK competencies among teacher educators, inservice teachers, and preservice teachers were discussed.

The study took place in the context of an in-service program during the trainees&rsquo; engagement in their practicum fieldwork activities including the process observation&ndash;reflection&ndash;design&ndash;implementation&ndash;reflection. We explored the features of this context that facilitated the trainees&rsquo; transition from the level of trainee educator to the level of teacher educator as well as the nature of the trainees&rsquo; documentation work for teachers. The results showed that observation of other teacher educators&rsquo; teaching in conjunction with reflection during the program&rsquo;s respective sessions facilitated the trainees&rsquo; transition to the professional level. The identified operational invariants underlying the trainees&rsquo; designs concerned the focus of their observation in teacher education classrooms, the importance they attributed to the constraints and opportunities provided by the wider educational context and epistemological issues regarding the teaching and learning of mathematics with technology. The analysis of trainees&rsquo; designs revealed three kinds of documents (&lsquo;explanatory,&rsquo; &lsquo;instructive&rsquo; and &ldquo;facilitative&rdquo;) and corresponding roles of trainees during the implementation.

With the efforts to conceptualize these knowledge domains comes the question to what extent they can be distinguished empirically. Hence, the present study examines a measure that assesses pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy in the technology-related TPACK dimensions (&ldquo;T-dimensions&rdquo;). In pursuit of crafting a validity argument, we investigated its factor structure and tested it for measurement invariance across gender and educational tracks, two subgroups that may indicate considerable differences. By means of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, the data of N = 665 pre-service teachers in 18 teacher training institutions in Flanders (Belgium) revealed a nested factor structure of the TPACK measure, which comprised a general factor and a specific factor of pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological knowledge. This factor structure was fully invariant across gender and educational tracks. Mean differences between educational tracks did not occur; yet, substantial differences were found across gender in favor of male pre-service teachers. This study sheds light on critical aspects of crafting a validity argument for the measurement of the T-dimensions in the TPACK framework and reports relevant subgroup differences.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Silva, P.

As their practice takes place within two different institutions (University and school) each has its own policy and agenda, the complexity of their practice environment rises and the context might become problematic. Thus, both personal and contextual factors within these two institutions were explored to draw a whole picture of the issue according to the sociocultural theory as the theoretical framework of the study. Case study was adopted as the research methodology using Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) questionnaire, classroom observation and semi-structured interviews to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample consisted of 15 participants; seven primary school pre-service teachers (science and mathematics), four university tutors and four head teachers. Two different categories of the pre-service teachers were identified; users and non-users of technology. Interestingly, those who used technology were found to adopt traditional transmission strategy of teaching. They perceived h5 agency assuming that their role is to transfer knowledge to passive learners through visual technology. In contrast, those who did not use technology assumed more active role by the pupils. Therefore, they thought visual technologies are not appropriate tools for a learner-centred strategy of teaching showing less awareness about the affordances that this type of technology could provide. Accessing guidance during teaching practice was found to be a significant element that could allow pre-service teachers to learn properly within their zone of proximal development and contribute considerably to their pedagogical identity development and their understanding of agency in the classroom. Moreover, teaching subject was found to be an important factor in shaping the pre-service teachers&rsquo; identity and practice.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alqallaf, N. (2016).

Furthermore, this study sought to understand teachers&rsquo; perceptions about their ability to create a collaborative cloud-computing learning environment that corresponds with the 21st century skills and possibly explain their readiness for future reformation of education in Kuwait.<br />Using an Internet-based format to this study quantitative and qualitative data, the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and barriers survey gleaned quantitative information about how mathematics teachers and a head of a mathematics department (n = 562) viewed use of technology as well as the barriers they faced in integrating it into the classroom. Also, qualitative data were collected using a survey of open-ended questions to provide context to survey answers and better understand the barriers and affordance experienced by the participants. Moreover, a 21st century open-ended questionnaire was employed to collect qualitative information from mathematics teachers and head of the departments (n = 21) in regard to their ability to construct a 21st century learning environment based on collaboration and constructivist perspective utilizing a cloud-computing technology. Quantitative analysis was utilized to examine elementary mathematics teachers&rsquo; perceptions using the TPACK survey, and the validity and reliability of the TPACK subscales were computed by administering the confirmatory factor analysis. Factors that were elicited were specified as: all seven subscales encompassed in the TPACK survey significantly fit model of factor structures, and the TPACK survey was reliable and valid. In addition, descriptive analysis such as the TPACK subscale means and standard deviations were computed via the SPSS software. Qualitative content analysis was used to understand teachers&rsquo; perceptions about their ability to integrate mobile technology, perceptions of the primary barriers and affordance that limited their ability, and their perceptions of their ability to integrate collaborative cloud computing and create a 21st century learning environment based on the constructivist perspective. When analyzed, the self-reported open-ended survey yielded the following specific themes: (a) teachers perceived themselves high in their ability to integrate mobile technology; (b) the primary barriers based on teachers&rsquo; perceptions were budget constraints, IT limitations, time constraints, and administrative support; and (c) teachers perceived themselves high in their ability to integrate collaborative cloud computing to construct a 21st century learning environment based on the constructivist perspective.

The ELL population in California is higher than the rest of the nation but California ELL students continue to underperform. This study argues that second language acquisition teaching strategies and methods must change to meet growing demand particularly in the areas of Language Arts and Mathematics. The theoretical framework for this study was Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK) and Sociocultural Learning. To achieve the three dimensions of TPCK, educators utilized hybrid teaching methods. A California school district with a high population of ELLs agreed to employ this study&rsquo;s prescribed curriculum for mathematics in random classrooms. The imposed approach for blended learning had multiple facets. The tool used to demonstrate the technological knowledge of TPCK was the ALEKS mathematics computer program. Simultaneously, teachers engaged students in small groups to achieve pedagogical knowledge . The final area of content knowledge aligned with Common Core State Standards.

Contrasting connectionist and transmissionist teachers&rsquo; use of technology provides a means of making such knowledge visible, allowing an exploration of the nature and content of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology. In addition, this study examines how and to what extent the mathematical knowledge made available through a teacher&rsquo;s interaction with technology is distributed across the teacher and technology. The first, quantitative phase of the project surveyed English secondary mathematics teachers&rsquo; use of technology (n=183). Using Rasch analysis to construct a transmissionist measure of self-reported pedagogic practice, a surprising association is found between frequent use of teacher-centred software and a more connectionist orientation. The survey data also suggests that &lsquo;teacher-centred&rsquo; practices involving ICT may instead be construed as &lsquo;dominant&rsquo; practices, since they are most frequently occurring across all teachers. In the second, qualitative phase of the project, two connectionist and two transmissionist teachers were selected as case studies on the basis of their responses to the survey instrument. Data collection involved a semi-structured interview based around a GeoGebra file on circle theorems, two classroom observations and postobservation interviews. Data analysis using the TPACK framework suggests the nature of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology as abstract, mathematical knowledge and yet simultaneously as mathematical knowledge situated in the context of teaching using technology. Using the Knowledge Quartet, a conceptualisation of the content of mathematical knowledge for teaching using technology in relation to the topic of circle theorems is developed, demonstrating the highly complex nature of such knowledge. Ameliorating this complexity, this study provides indications of how a distributed view of cognition might offer potential strategies for facilitating teacher interaction with technology.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Champion, R.

Retrieved from http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/ece_diss/30</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;While digital technologies have been recognized as a necessary part of school learning, a digital divide persists between those who have technological access and those without technological access. African American children in impoverished, urban areas may lack the same opportunities to use technology as children in higher socioeconomic status (SES) areas. Research demonstrates that schools may serve as an equalizer in bridging this digital divide. Thus, students who attend schools in low SES comminuties can benefit from the integration of Digital Literacies (DL) during literacy instruction. This qualitative study examined how teachers in an urban, low SES school struggled to utilize DL in ways that challenged traditional literacy practices. To understand these struggles, this study examined how elementary teachers within this demographic used DL in response to the demands for technology during literacy instruction. Guiding questions included: a) What pedagogical practices do teachers of African American children in urban, low SES classrooms use when integrating digital tools during their literacy instruction? b) How do these teachers&rsquo; perceptions of Digital Literacies&rsquo;s usefulness impact the ways they use Digital Literacies during their literacy instruction? c) What challenges do the teachers face and how do they respond to these challenges as they integrate Digital Literacies in their classrooms? Data collected included observations of teachers during Digital Literacies lessons, individual and focus group interviews, audio-journals entires, curriculum maps, and lesson plans. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method to allow themes to emerge. Results from this qualitative study revealed that teachers exhibited three levels of Implementation of DL, including Limited, Moderate, and Full Implementation. Examination of teachers&rsquo; pedagogical practices using the TPACK rubric and the SAMR model of integration revealed that a teachers&rsquo;s willingness to implement DL is dependent upon variations in the level of DL knowledge and intangible variables such as a teacher&rsquo;s beliefs toward technology, a teachers&rsquo; comfort level, and the teacher&rsquo;s response to challenges that occur.

Abstract retrieved from http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.706290</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology was highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development and the United Nations Educational Organisation as an important feature in teacher professional development. Both Organisations stressed the importance of teachers having pedagogical understanding of its uses rather than simply being trained to integrate it into classroom practice. The Teaching Council of Ireland responded to this by developing policy on the Continuum of Teacher Education (CPD), aimed at enabling teachers to develop innovative methodologies including technology integration. This inquiry builds on in-school CPD using a framework known as Technology, Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) within a situational learning environment. The methodological approach is positioned within digital narrative inquiry concentrating on the narration of four teachers across the curriculum. The design comprises two forms of story by each teacher as data. The first is an instructional digital story for use in a curriculum lesson, while the second is a reflection on the experience of creating and using the instructional digital story. Each teacher&rsquo;s narrative is presented after using a thematic analysis in relation to the TPACK framework, challenges and opportunities. The findings indicate professional development of learning a new technology tool such as Digital Story depends on a teachers ability to see a clear connection between the technology and content as well as its pedagogical uses. The style of instructional story created by each teacher is influenced by personal belief in the value of storytelling for instruction and the appropriateness of its use in certain areas of the curriculum. Common challenges focused on time needed to create, use of personal voice recordings and image selection. Rewards indicated increased self efficacy, greater student engagement and acceleration of learning. The situational learning environment developed enthusiasm to create future Digital Stories and aroused interest from other teachers in the school.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cumbee, C. M. V.

The problem addressed in this study is that U.S. legislation requires all public school students to be prepared to function in a technology-driven society, yet socio-economically disadvantaged students and parents are less likely to have technology access outside of school. The purpose of this qualitative case study was two-fold, and sought to investigate rural elementary teachers&rsquo; experiences of: 1) utilizing technology to teach low socio-economic students with diverse needs and little or no technology access outside of school; and, 2) using technology in parent-teacher conferences with parents who have limited or no technology in the home. The sample included ten teacher participants. All participants are certified teachers currently employed at the rural school study site teaching in grades first through fifth. Participants completed an open-ended, qualitative, online questionnaire about technology practices in the classroom. Findings revealed that there were barriers with the quality, rather than the quantity of technology used in rural, low-income schools, which included slower internet speeds and technology delivery issues. Barriers to communication with families included family&rsquo;s lack of cell phone access and affordability. Despite technology barriers, it was found that technology increased student engagement and motivation in learning. One suggestion for future research is to conduct a quantitative study to assess technology usage in rural schools within low income communities in the state where this study was conducted and in rural areas across America.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depew, R.

(UMI No. 3734106)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is understood that principals play a key role the integration of computer technology their schools, however there have been limited studies exploring the level of technology knowledge and technology leadership skills possessed by school principals and how these measures relate to each other. Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is a popular framework for understanding the teacher knowledge required for effective technology integration. This framework has been used to study a number of different populations including pre-service and in-service teachers in a variety of grade levels, subject areas, and pedagogical contexts. This is the first time this framework has been applied to school principals. Technology leadership capacity for this study was defined by the ISTE Standards for Administrators, which define the skills school leaders need to support the successful use and integration of computer technology.<br />The purpose of this study was to adapt and apply the TPACK framework to school principals, to measure the technology leadership skills of those principals, and to identify whether a relationship exists between the measures. This study employed two distinct survey instruments that were delivered online. The Principal TPACK Survey used in this study was adapted from an existing TPACK survey by Schmidt et al. (2009). The Technology Leadership Inventory (TLI) is an original instrument developed to align with and measure the leadership skills represented in the ISTE Standards for Administrators.<br />In addition to providing baseline data for principal TPACK and principal technology leadership capacities, results indicate a h5 positive correlation between TPACK and their technology leadership capacities. Additionally, results indicate principals are more knowledgeable of more traditional, non-technological conceptions of pedagogy and content. Finally, because of the h5 correlation between the two measures, it is recommended that in order to improve the technology leadership ability of principals, special consideration should be given to building knowledge emphasizing the connection between technology, pedagogy, and content that is specific to classroom contexts rather than more managerial applications.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dillon, P.

Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10261930)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study was to examine administrator, student, and teacher perceptions of organizational structures, systems, and supports implemented to aid technology integration, and the potential for that technology integration to achieve 21st century skill acquisition and deeper learning in a 1:1 environment. The Diffusion of Innovation Theoretical Framework guided the design and analysis of this study. Further, a literature review of the integration of technology into content and pedagogy informed this study. The overarching research question for this study asked how teachers, students, and administrators perceive the implementation of a 1:1 district-wide implementation initiative, and its impact on 21st century skill acquisition and deeper learning. As such, the study sought to answer the following questions: (1) How has the district organized itself to support technology integration by teachers with the specific intent of fostering deeper learning and 21st century skills? and (2) How do administrators, teachers, and students perceive the implementation of 1:1 and its impact on 21st century skills and deeper learning? An instrumental case study approach was used to explore and describe the perceptions of administrators, students and teachers using rich quote of their experiences. It is evident that the purposeful integration of technology in the 1:1 environment led to student acquisition of 21st century skills and deeper learning at the study site. In addition, the study revealed structures and supports necessary to facilitate 1:1 programs to foster deeper learning and 21st century skills including h5 communication, robust infrastructure, long-range planning, stakeholder engagement, professional learning, collaboration and time. The findings of this study, along with the identification and analysis of related themes, have the potential to inform similar districts as they embark on the implementation of 1:1 programs to foster 21st century skills and deeper learning competencies.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Duncan, P.

Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 3738651)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;There are a variety of factors that can facilitate or constrain technology use in classrooms (Hew &amp; Brush, 2006). Using a modified version of the framework for Conditions for Classroom Technology Innovations (Zhao et al., 2002), this study explored how the innovator, innovation, and context impact technology use in four K-5 elementary schools. The TPACK framework was used to analyze teacher knowledge and support structures (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Research has called for more contextualized studies in schools, that include stakeholders like teachers and administrators, and that focus on supports like vision, access to technology, training, collaboration, and technical support. Of particular importance is not just the availability of these supports but how well they flexibly and responsively meet the needs of teachers (Granger et al., 2002; Rutkowski et al., 2011). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a program evaluation to determine the needs of teachers using the framework so the district could improve context supports to better meet teacher needs and improve teaching practices. Study participants included fifty-eight teachers who participated in a survey&mdash;twenty of whom also participated in focus groups. Other relevant stakeholders included technology coaches, principals, tech support personnel, and central office administrators who participated in interviews or focus groups. The findings established a wide variety of needs that could benefit from greater responsiveness from the supports the district has established. The innovators demonstrated a need for more ongoing, detailed training for basic technical knowledge before widespread integration at the level of TPACK could be established. With increased access to a variety of technologies, &ldquo;easy and efficient&rdquo; use is needed if teachers are going to be able to properly integrate the number of tools that are becoming available to them due to decreased costs for new technology. Also important were underlying beliefs that were hindering greater technology integration, particularly with decentralizing the classroom for more student-centered practices. Teachers had a variety of &ldquo;distances&rdquo; between themselves and technology, and between the desired technology practices and their current practices. The implications call for the district to more purposely use teachers&rsquo; needs to drive the flexible supports it already has in place. This includes articulating a short-term vision and improving the coordination of support structures to help all teachers meet the vision. Those supports would involve ongoing discussions about teacher pedagogical beliefs, increased coaching during the school day, structured collaboration to meet the vision, and more ongoing training for basic technical knowledge. This study shows the importance of using all relevant stakeholders to evaluate a program for improved practices and to use teacher needs to coordinate improved context supports.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ellis, J.

(UMI No. 3727953)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;For decades, there has been a nationwide demand to increase the number of science teachers in K-12 education (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983; National Research Council [NRC], 2007). This demand is in large part due to increases in state science graduation requirements. Teacher preparation programs have been preparing new science teachers on pace with the resulting increase in demand (Ingersoll &amp; Merrill, 2010), however, shortages have continued as up to 50% of these new teachers leave the profession within their first five years of teaching (Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004), creating a &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; phenomenon as districts scramble to address this early attrition with yet more beginning teachers. We need to address what Ingersoll (2012) describes as the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the teaching force: the fact that an increasingly large segment of the teaching force is comprised of beginning teachers who are at a high risk of leaving the profession.<br />The three related studies that comprise this dissertation focus on the role of technological interventions for in-service and pre-service science teachers. The context for the first two studies is TIN, an online induction program for beginning secondary science teachers. These two studies consider the impact of technological supports on the reflective practice of participating teachers. The design interventions included VideoANT (an online video annotation tool) and Teachers as Leaders roles (a structured response protocol) for the Venture/Vexation online forum activity. The context for the third study is T3-S, a university licensure course for pre-service science teachers designed to explore technology integration in secondary science classrooms. This study investigated the impact of pre-service teacher participation in the creation of an Adventure Learning (AL) environment (Doering, 2006) on their understanding of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) and its role in their future science instruction. The supporting interventions took the form of three separate groups of pre-service teachers, each tasked with a specific role in the creation of the AL environment.<br />Findings from the first two studies indicate that specific, explicit supports for teacher discourse in TIN activities is needed in order to foster the reflective practice that course designers and instructor-facilitators desire. The third study reveals that pre-service teacher participation in the creation of an AL environment supported their understanding of the nature of TPACK and allowed them to define their content-based technology pedagogy for future science instruction.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ferrari, K.

(UMI No. 10247074)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Nikolaraizi, Verkiri and Easterbrooks (2013) documented how deaf learners can benefit from the use of visual supports in the classroom. Technology provides the tools to create a robust visual learning environment (Smith &amp; Okolo, 2010). For teachers to facilitate learning in a technology rich environment, they themselves must be comfortable with the tools and understand how to effectively integrate their use into curricular delivery. This project examines the design, implementation and evaluation of a professional development program that was created to educate deaf education teachers about the use of the educational software, Clicker6. The Clicker6 Professional Development program was designed specifically to integrate the use of technology with the newly adapted bilingual curricular approach to teaching English Language Arts (ELA). The Clicker6 Professional Development Program consists of four teacher improvement goals: (1) to build competency in the use of the Clicker6 software; (2) to promote understanding of the connection among Clicker6 software, literacy content and pedagogy; (3) to provide time to create instructional classroom materials in Clicker6 directly aligned to teachers&rsquo; curriculum goal; (4) to support teachers&rsquo; continuing training as they implement Clicker6 in the classroom. Following teacher participation in the program, an investigation was conducted to understand and characterize the impact of the program on teacher learning. Specifically, this effort focused on three key questions: (1) What impact did the Clicker6 professional development program have on the teachers&rsquo; technical ability to operate the software?; (2) How did participation in the Clicker6 training influence teachers&rsquo; use of the software in relation to English Language Arts (ELA) curricular content in the classroom?; and (3) What were the teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the Clicker6 professional development program? Fifteen English language arts (ELA) teachers participated in the Clicker6 professional development program. Four sessions of training were offered during a single in-service day, and focused upon use of Clicker6 software as a classroom instructional tool. The program continued the following week with an in-class support session in which the facilitator offered assistance while the teacher used the technology in the classroom. Approximately two weeks after the initial professional development sessions, the teachers met together with the facilitator for 45 minutes of support follow-up. Data were collected through surveys, observations, and interviews. Survey data examined changes in Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) among teachers before and after their participation in the professional development. Observation rubrics were used to assess the teachers&rsquo; demonstrated ability in the use of the software as a result of the professional development. Finally, interviews were used to collect qualitative data regarding teachers&rsquo; perceptions of the professional development program.<br />Findings indicated that teachers were positive regarding the Clicker6 professional development offering. Further, findings suggested an increase in teachers&rsquo; capacity to technically operate the Clicker6 software and integrate it into their curriculum following the training. Recommendations were made in regard to planning and design of future technology-related professional development with the goal of improving its effectiveness. These include: (a) provide multiple sections of training based on teachers&rsquo; technology competency; (b) schedule sessions over the course of a school year; (c) provide monthly email communication with tips and tutorials; (d) schedule teacher-to-teacher observations of the use of Clicker6 in the classroom setting; (e) expand professional development for other subject areas; (f) add a session on managing student use of the software; and (g) add a session on technical trouble shooting.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fitzgerald, A.

This study utilized the Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design, which was implemented in two phases. The research was designed to investigate how veteran secondary teachers in a Southwest Florida public school district are being affected by the pedagogical movement concerning the integration of educational technology. In phase one of the study, quantitative data was collected from 97 veteran secondary teachers at five secondary schools utilizing the online Teachers&rsquo; Use and Perceptions Survey (TUPS), developed by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida. In phase two, convenience sampling was used to select 10 teachers from the veteran secondary teachers who participated in the survey. Qualitative data was collected during face-to-face interviews which utilized open-ended interview questions that were developed following an analysis of the survey results. Overall, veteran secondary teachers&rsquo; perceptions were positive; they believe that technology enhances their teaching, perceive the benefits of technology in terms of supporting their classroom instruction, and feel h5ly that student use of technology enhances students&rsquo; performance. Most veteran secondary teachers indicated they feel comfortable using technology in their teaching and believe they use technology effectively in their teaching for instructional delivery, as a communication tool, and for students&rsquo; independent learning. These teachers also indicated a need for comprehensive technology training, a supportive learning network, opportunities to explore technology applications, and time to plan for technology integration as a pedagogical strategy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Glazer, K.

(UMI No. 10583408)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multiple case study examines four groups of secondary mathematics teachers engaged in a Lesson Study approach to professional development where they planned and taught lessons that integrate technology. Informed by current literature, a framework was developed to focus on the dimensions of teacher&rsquo;s knowledge to teach mathematics with technology that appear to influence teacher&rsquo;s decisions during lesson planning. These dimensions of teacher&rsquo;s knowledge include knowledge of mathematics, knowledge of pedagogy, knowledge of technology, and other types of knowledge that are developed by the interactions of those. At the beginning and end of the Lesson Study, quantitative data was collected using a pre-post survey to measure changes in teacher&rsquo;s self-perceptions of the knowledge to teach mathematics with technology. Qualitative data was collected as the groups engaged in designing a mathematical lesson, as a volunteer teacher from each group implemented that lesson, and as a group reflected in the planning and implementation of the lesson. This includes audio recordings, video recordings, and field notes. Results of this study demonstrate that when teachers are engaged in professional development activities that are focused on having teachers plan thoughtful and detailed lessons that integrate technology, their self-perceptions of their mathematical knowledge (MK), technological knowledge (TK), and technological, pedagogical, and mathematical knowledge (TPACK) increases significantly. Finding suggests that professional development opportunities where teachers collaborate with colleagues could motivate the integration of technology tools into teaching, and could stimulate changes to pedagogical approaches. Findings also suggest that when teachers exhibit appropriate mathematical knowledge, and have in-depth discussions about the pedagogical approach to take, the integration of technology seemed to flow naturally. Findings also suggest that when teachers seemed to lack mathematical understanding of the topic being taught, and are not willing or motivated to change their pedagogical approaches, they do not use technology in ways that can potentially impact students&rsquo; engagement with mathematical ideas.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Grosser, D.

Co-teaching, a special education service delivery model, involves a general and special educator who share responsibility for planning, delivering, and assessing instruction (Friend, 2014). Through the lens of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), I explored the perspectives and experiences of four co-teaching pairs who regularly integrated technology into instruction. Study results suggested that these teachers held knowledge, beliefs, and values that influenced their classroom practices. The micro-level contextual elements in the teachers&rsquo; workplaces, along with meso-levels supports, influenced how the teachers built and shared knowledge with and from each other. Their collaborative relationships, which were based upon parity, respect, and communication, supported a professional work environment of sharing and learning. As these teachers engaged in dialogue within their teaching and learning partnerships, individually-held knowledge (TPACK) was distributed between the co-teachers. Content-, grade-, and school-level collaborations addressing technology integration also resulted in the distribution of TPACK school-wide. Implications of these results include recommendations for how school leaders may support effective co-teaching, which can enhance teachers&rsquo; professional learning related to technology integration and encourage the development of distributed knowledge.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Heintzelman, S.C.

A multiple embedded case study design was used to describe how a school leadership team supports a school culture for technology integration within classrooms where special education teachers integrate technology to engage students with EBD. The primary case of school culture includes a comprehensive quote of how the school leadership team supports a culture for technology integration within classrooms. Embedded cases within the primary case describe how special education teachers integrate technology to engage students with EBD in classroom instruction. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2005) is part of the conceptual framework to theoretically undergird the study. The findings of this study describe a school that serves students with EBD where there is a h5 school culture and leaders support teachers who integrate technology to engage students. Patterns from the analysis indicate school leaders plan for staff development, participate in staff development sessions with teachers, observe teachers, provide feedback about teacher performance, and praise and encourage teachers to integrate technology. Teachers and leaders engage in formal and informal staff development opportunities to learn how to integrate technology into classroom lessons. As a result of these trainings and school leader support, teachers provide clear expectations for students while integrating technology to engage students, provide direct instruction, choices, and visual representation of content.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Henton, M.

Faculty also reported that they were confident in their digital technology knowledge and the foundational competencies measured by the TPACK Vocational Self-efficacy scale. In addition, they indicated high levels of access to basic forms of ICT, but only limited access to the newer forms of ICT. Faculty expressed competence in using common applications such as word processing, desktop publishing, presentation software, spreadsheets, and email. However, significant differences were found between departments for the use of ICT to enhance teaching and learning, to transform teaching and learning, interests and attitudes toward using ICT, access to different forms of ICT, digital technology knowledge, and competence in using some ICT applications.

High school teachers who volunteered to develop courses for the consortium attempted the task without previous training in online course design and facilitation. High school students enrolled in the courses often did not successfully complete them, which obstructed the mission of the consortium. The purpose of this qualitative single critical case study was to explore teachers&rsquo; experiences with and perceptions of designing and developing online courses without accompanying professional development. The iNACOL National Standards for Quality Online Courses (v2) and technological, pedagogical, content knowledge (TPACK) served as the conceptual frameworks for the study. Five teachers who developed and facilitated an online course for the consortium, without companion professional development, volunteered to be interviewed. Data were reduced using NVivo software and analyzed using a priori codes based on NACOL standards then open-coded for emerging themes. Results indicated that other than content expertise, teachers did not believe they had sufficient competencies in any of the areas identified in the iNACOL standards. Based on these results, an online professional development course for teachers was designed to provide introductory training and to model elements of quality online course design using the Moodle learning management system. Positive social change may be achieved if teachers have the knowledge and skills required to develop high-caliber, innovative, and convenient education opportunities that encourage students&rsquo; course completion which leads to learning and academic success.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Luna, A.

Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10194879)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Several studies suggest that if evidence-based school innovations are to be successful, schools must possess adequate capacity to implement them with quality. This paper utilizes a framework of organizational readiness called R=MC2 , positing that readiness to implement with quality consists of three components: general capacities, innovation-specific capacities, and motivation. Specifically, this paper investigates whether certain key characteristics of professional development (active learning, integration, time for practice, collaboration, tailoring, coaching, and provision of feedback) can impact teacher motivation to implement novel educational practices. The paper answers two major research questions: 1) Which characteristics of quality professional development (PD) are related to each of the components of motivation described in the R=MC2 model? and 2) Is motivation a significant mediator of the relation between quality professional development and teacher implementation of new practices? Data for this study were collected from a district-wide one-to-one computing initiative in a Southeastern school district. The purpose of the initiative was to provide each student in grades 3-12 with a personal laptop or tablet, with the goal of increasing personalized, authentic, collaborative, and tech-integrated (PAC-Tech) learning in the district. Data were collected from two sources: 1,509 teachers completed a survey relating to PD at their school, their motivation to implement the initiative, and their use of PAC-Tech learning in the classroom. In addition, four district-level Technology Integration Specialists (TIS) provided data concerning PD quality at each of the district&rsquo;s schools as a secondary source of data. Mediation analyses revealed that motivation was a significant mediator of the relation between PD quality and teacher implementation quality. Using multi-level regression, analyses suggest that the most influential characteristics of PD on motivation are 1) integration of new ideas with teachers&rsquo; existing knowledge, 2) tailoring PD to teachers&rsquo; individual needs and preferences, 3) providing opportunities for collaboration among teachers, and 4) providing consistent feedback to teachers. Thus, the present results predict that schools that design PD that integrates new and familiar concepts to make it easy for teachers to learn a new practice, that allow teachers to work together in learning that practice, that provide feedback to teachers during the learning process, and that survey teachers about their specific needs, preferences, and learning styles are more likely to secure buy-in and support from teachers for a particular innovation. Further, this buy-in is subsequently related to the likelihood and quality of teacher implementation of that innovation. These results are likely to be of interest to schools and school districts seeking to enhance implementation of educational innovations and increase teacher buy-in for using novel, evidence-based strategies.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Matty, J.A.

The aim of this research was to provide information and recommendations to educators of the district concerning the planning of lessons and integration of technology in high-stake subject contexts. The data collected provided information regarding a teacher&rsquo;s planning of lessons that integrated technology in high-stake tested and non-tested subjects. A TPACK- Based Technology Integration Assessment Rubric was used to evaluate the lesson planning of 435 teachers in English and Science subjects in either a high-stake tested or non-tested context. ANOVA testing was completed to measure statistically the differences among the lesson planning within the same subject area and context while t-tests were completed for comparison between high-stake tested and non-tested subjects for Science and English. The results of the study indicated that technology integration was influenced by context when comparing high-stake tested Biology with non-tested Science subjects. In contrast, results between high-stake tested and non-tested English subjects did not support the hypothesis that a high-stake tested context was a barrier to technology integration. Based on these results, a Six-Step Growth Design Process was developed to further investigate the influence of subject and individual teacher planning habitus upon the high-stake context barrier to technology integration. The Six-Step Growth Design Process will be implemented to increase technology integration in the classroom and improve its use in different contexts.

A school environment where teachers are expected to educate themselves on how to integrate technology into the classroom will not adequately produce students for today&rsquo;s digital world. The purpose of this study was to relate differences in the technology integration of K-12 public school teachers to the adoption of the TPACK framework into a school district&rsquo;s professional development model. This mixed methods constructivist/interpretivist case study assessed the efficacy of professional development of K-12 public school teachers on their practice of integrating the TPACK framework. The proposed research explained how the technology integration of individual teachers is affected by professional development offered, measured how the teachers&rsquo; practice of integrating the TPACK framework relates to the professional development offered, and identified best practices for professional development.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Miller, S.

(UMI No. 10270262)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates instructional moves by teachers in mathematics classrooms in which technology-based activities (i.e., student-oriented simulations) and features of those simulations influence classroom practices. Four teachers were studied over the course of a year as an exploratory study to build interpretive cases that described instructional practices in technology-based lessons. Teachers developed lessons using PhET simulations designed to support algebraic reasoning. Data sources included teachers&rsquo; process of selecting and designing lessons, observations of teachers&rsquo; non-technology and technology-based mathematical activities, and teacher interviews and reflections.</p>\n<p>This work was based on a conceptual framework blending the ideas of Mathematical Tasks (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 1998), Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), in which teachers&rsquo; instructional practices are determined by teachers&rsquo; mathematical pedagogical content knowledge, task selection and design, and use of technology.</p>\n<p>Results indicated that teachers see simulations as having significant benefits in the classroom. Teachers leveraged these opportunities by increasing class discussions, engaging in higher levels of thinking and reasoning, and focusing on mathematical representations. When teachers used simulations, the teachers spent less time in direct instruction, focused more on the mathematics, and focused more on investigations rather than drill-oriented tasks.</p>\n<p>Technology in the classroom, however, was problematic for some teachers. The very nature of students working independently with their own devices meant that student-student interactions decreased in some lessons. Furthermore, teachers&rsquo; discomfort in managing technology seems to limit ongoing use.</p>\n<p>Specific features of the simulations that prompted instructional moves included the ability to support conceptual understanding and build student engagement. Simulations also provided a &lsquo;low floor, high ceiling,&rsquo; supporting differentiation, and a dynamic responsiveness, facilitating connections between representations. On the other hand, teachers raised concerns that some features of the simulation could do the math for the students. Furthermore, the perception of simulations as being a game may impact how and when simulations are used.</p>\n<p>The emergent use of technology in math classrooms is under-supported. For simulations to be used in a more extensive fashion in mathematics classes, professional development and curricular materials are needed to support implementation.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Morquin, D.

Synthesizing the work of Mishra &amp; Koehler (2006) and Bauer (2014), this dissertation operationalizes a broader, more contemporary definition of instructional technology that goes beyond the traditional conception of mere instructional tool towards one that is more protean, unstable, and opaque. Research questions about technology&rsquo;s impact on music education are central to this curriculum study and evolve into considerations on how the relationship of popular music and instructional technology shape a pedagogy for popular music education. Making use of principles rooted in aesthetic education, critical pedagogy, and TPACK, the curriculum created fulfills the requirements of an undergraduate program in music education mapped onto the National Association of Schools of Music standards. Presented along with a standards map are course overviews, syllabi, and lesson plans that specifically make use of the theoretical backgrounds discussed.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rae, G. (2017).

Retrieved from https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/13427</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The practice of students bringing their own device to school BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) has now become reasonably common in New Zealand primary schools after being first introduced in the late 1990s. It has become a strategy that schools can use to provide 21st century learning opportunities for students without having to provide school-&shy;‐owned devices. This study raises important questions for teachers and schools to ask themselves before implementing BYOD.<br />This study explores the experiences of three New Zealand primary school teachers as they introduce BYOD into their classrooms. The case study sought to understand what factors impacted on their ability to implement new pedagogical practices and how professional learning might help support teachers with BYOD.<br />The literature review examines national and international literature on the implementation and impact of BYOD. It discusses how and why teachers do or do not engage with ICT in classrooms and how BYOD impacts on their practice. This case study utilises SAMR (Puentedura, 2006) and TPACK (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) in order to analyse the data and discuss the findings. The findings suggest that, in order for teachers to maximise the potential of BYOD, professional learning and technical support is essential. The teachers experienced a number of challenges as they introduced BYOD, yet all managed to persevere and remain positive as they trialled new teaching methods, and utilised new programs and applications.<br />The study concludes by making a number of pertinent recommendations that can be actioned by schools in order to ensure implementation is smooth and successful. It is very important that teachers are supported adequately by the school and are given opportunities to engage in relevant and timely professional learning.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ritter, D.S.

Retrieved from http://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2135</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technology is becoming quite pervasive in society at large. Its integration into secondary schools and its use with curriculum requires a unique knowledge of its purposeful articulation as it relates to curriculum goals and student outcomes. Therefore, this study will focus on how an educator&rsquo;s decision-making process determines how technology will be integrated within the planning process of secondary educators, and how these decisions may be affected by an educator&rsquo;s technological pedagogical content knowledge, otherwise known as TPACK.<br />Qualitative analysis was then used to evaluate a Technology Integration Rationale (TIR) that was produced by members of a rural professional development cohort. Qualitative analysis was also conducted on transcribed face-to-face semi-structured interviews. The TIR and the interviews involved a cohort representing a rural school district who attended a professional development course that was facilitated by a University in the Rocky Mountain West. The TIR was then scored using a valid rubric to measure an educator&rsquo;s TPACK score. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were transcribed by hand to gain a sense of an educator&rsquo;s understanding of the TPACK framework as it relates to the purposeful use of technology in lesson decision-making.<br />The study found that one&rsquo;s growing familiarity with the use of a specific technology could affect an educator&rsquo;s self-assessed TPACK score. Once an educator understood how to use a specific technology its familiarity made it transparent or simply just another piece of the curriculum. The study also found that barriers can have a significant effect on an educators&rsquo; decision making when deciding to use technology, and as a result affects an educator&rsquo;s self-assessed TPACK score.<br />Recommendations for further study include examining how the familiarity or transparent nature of technology can affect curricular decision-making, future professional development regarding the TPACK framework, and educator beliefs or efficacy as it relates to integrating technology.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rubadeau, Z.

An exploration of English language teacher educators&rsquo; cognitions and practices in relation to the pedagogical purposes and efficacies of 21st-century digital technologies (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10175482)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This multiple case study investigates English language (EL) teacher educators&rsquo; cognitions and practices related to pedagogical technology integration. The focus concerns five native-English speaking teacher educators (TEs) within a teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) training program at a South Korean university. The goal was to determine 1) TESOL-TEs&rsquo; cognitions regarding the pedagogical purposes and efficacies of 21st&ndash;century digital technologies, 2) TESOL-TEs&rsquo; uses of such technologies in their practice, and 3) factors related to TESOL-TEs&rsquo; decisions of whether and how to integrate technologies into their praxis. Data collected over twenty weeks in 2013 included four rounds of semi-structured interviews and two sets of classroom observations for each of the five focal participants, interviews with program administrators, written reflections, field notes, photographs, and document review. Data were coded using King&rsquo;s (2004) template analysis method. Categories were based on constructs from the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra and Koehler, 2006) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et al., 2003) and UTAUT 2 (Venkatesh et al., 2012). The focal participants displayed high levels of TPACK and used Web 2.0 applications extensively to facilitate interactions in their roles as teacher educators. It was found that UTAUT factors guided TEs&rsquo; decisions and use behaviour to varying degrees, but that the mediating factor of age did not relate to TEs&rsquo; decisions in the manner predicted by the UTAUT. TEs&rsquo; cognitions both coincided with and diverged from their practices. This study contributes to research gaps on the roles, cognitions, and technology-related practices of TESOL-TEs in South Korea. Research on TEs in different contexts is recommended to gain further insights into the connections among these factors. TESOL program administrators and TEs will particularly benefit from the light shed on teacher educator cognitions and practices in this study.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Schneider, B. (2017). Virtual civic engagement: Exploring technology, secondary social studies, and problem based learning with TPACK (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 10254590)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Sociological and cultural analysts have noted the reticence of public secondary schooling to recognize and build academic activities around the participatory culture in which adolescents are so readily involved (Jenkins, Purushotma, Weigel, Clinton &amp; Robison, 2009). Despite the Common Core State Standards having required students to demonstrate they can maximize technology to perform a range of skills involving targeted specialized research, organized writing, and visually intentional presentation (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices [NGA], Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSSO], 2010), very few classrooms have followed through. The avoidance and or failure of these educational technology integrations in secondary subject content classes raised questions. A survey of the literature showcases the many ways in which technologies were not fully matched to the tasks, expectations, or teacher skills. The mystery of epic technological classroom can be resolved if we apply the lens of Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge (Shulman, 1986; Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) which speaks about the interactions and alignment tensions among these three areas. When one has applied this TPACK lens we can best understand a range of surveyed literature that speaks to disconnect among technology affordances, teacher pedagogies, and requirements of content knowledge. Among a range of TPACK research emerges a sub-set that advocates for the value of cognitive scaffolding through hard scaffolds and soft scaffolds (Saye &amp; Brush, 2002). Previous research has suggested the hard scaffolds can offer a built pedagogy filled with student project expectations and that soft scaffolds can provide specific practices support that is customized and relevant for participants. This research study engages in design-based research to refine hard and soft scaffolds to support high school social studies students through a multi-phase oral history project. Engaging 2 sections of students at a progressive public high school, the researcher engaged in a two-iteration cycle of design activities between November 2014 and March 2015. A student work digital portfolio was turned in after students used the first iteration scaffolds. After a teacher-provided analysis of student work using the researchers provided rubric, tweaks were made to the scaffolds. A post-interview with participant teachers provided further refinement.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seamster, C. L. (2016).

(UMI No. 10583070)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;According to Molnar (2014), full time virtual school education lacks a measurement tool that accurately measures effective virtual teacher practice. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, the current study sought to understand the common practices among full time K-8 virtual school teachers, the extent to which teachers believed such practices impacted student learning, as well as the methods in which current standards, recommendations and practices were implemented in the full time K-8 virtual school setting. The relationship between virtual school teacher practices and their Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) was also explored. Using the standards, practices and recommendations developed for online learning from International Association for K&ndash;12 Online Learning (iNACOL), National Education Association (NEA), Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) a team of focus group members gave input on the common practices for teaching students in the full time K-8 virtual school environment. The results included 11 general virtual school teacher practices, 12 teacher practices relating to evaluation and three practices relating to special needs and diverse learners. Qualitative and quantitative findings indicated that teachers most frequently meet the established practices through the following strategies: phone conferences, live sessions with students, feedback on assessments, webmail communication, professional development, collaborating with peers/teacher collaboration, professional learning communities, curriculum based assessments on the phone, communicating with family stakeholders, and determining students in the bottom quartile. A framework for K-8 full time virtual school pedagogy which includes evaluating student learning and individualizing instruction through technology tools and collaborative methods was developed.</p>\n<p>Finally, the quantitative findings indicated that of the three virtual school teacher practice categories (teacher practice, evaluation and special needs and diverse learners), evaluation was the leading predictor of teacher TPACK scores. Specifically, collaboration, having an online voice and presence, and using data from assessments to modify instruction were found to significantly predict a teacher&rsquo;s Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge. Using virtual school teachers&rsquo; expertise on the practices which most impact student learning and the methods for implementing virtual school teacher practices, the researcher created a draft full time K-8 virtual school teacher evaluation rubric.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sintema, E.

While the TPACK framework has been employed in many studies associated with use of technology in the classrooms, reports on the pre-service teachers&rsquo; development of TPACK-Math are inadequate to provide comprehensive quote. With the aim to investigate the changes in pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; perceptions regarding the use of technology subsequent to their university training in mathematics teaching, this study employed cluster analysis to categorize teachers into groups based on their self-reported TPACK-Math profiles. The study also employed the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to check and identify the TPACK-Math profile differences of the pre-service primary teachers based on their year of study and multiple regression analysis to find out which of the TPACK-Math domains had a significant influence on pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards integration of ICT in mathematics instruction. For this purpose, quantitative data analysis had been made with data from a single survey design study on pre-service primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward integration of ICT in instruction that collected information from a sample of 166 male and female pre-service primary teachers. Cluster analysis revealed three categories of pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK-Math profiles. ANOVA revealed significant TPACK-Math profile differences of the pre-service primary teachers based on their year of study and multiple regression analysis revealed that contextual knowledge and technological knowledge have the most significant influence on preservice primary teachers&rsquo; attitudes toward integration of ICT in instruction for this sample.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Teague, H.

The results indicated TPACK and learning-centered pedagogy were necessary but insufficient conditions for the transformation levels of iPad integration. Technology itself might not bring a pedagogical shift. Learning to teach with technology could be a catalyst that triggers changes in teaching practices.

Analysis of data collected from these sources was conducted in two cycles, open-ended coding (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008) then hypothesis coding (Salda&ntilde;a, 2016). Findings indicated that participants utilized pedagogical content knowledge and technological pedagogical content knowledge in different ways when planning. Notably, misunderstandings about content knowledge may be somewhat accommodated by integrating technology into literacy instruction. Further, teachers each had different stances towards integrating technology that influenced their planned instruction. Finally, while most elements of the TIPC were found in the participants&rsquo; planning, teachers varied in their ability to focus on the instructional goal.

Developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in educatio competencies in a Chinese normal university: The role of curriculum leaders (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database. (UMI No. 3734720)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Looking at higher education in China, in addition to the political control of the central government, the top-down curriculum management system of the universities seems to support the effectiveness of teacher education programmes. Thus, the demand for information and communications technology (ICT) in teacher education not only affects the context and structure of teacher education programmes, but also challenges the role of curriculum leaders. As the core of all other leadership activities (Wiles, 2009), curriculum leadership is responsible for both the maintenance and improvement of teacher education programmes. Furthermore, in creating a meaningful learning context, it is vital for pre-service teachers to develop ICT in education competencies. Therefore, there are research gaps in the investigation of how curriculum leadership supports or hinders teacher education programmes in the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. This study is intended to fill in the research gaps. It poses the following guiding questions to explore the theme in greater depth. First, how do teacher education programmes affect the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies? Second, how does curriculum leadership shape teacher education programmes, and how do those programmes shape it in turn? Third, what are the roles of curriculum leaders in developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies?</p>\n<p>This study was conducted at Guangxi Normal University (GXNU), a provincial normal university in mainland China. Based on the theoretical and contextual background, its conceptual framework was contextualised in three top-down layers of administration, including the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Guangxi Provincial Department of Education and GXNU. The curriculum leaders at the university, subordinate school and classroom levels constitute the curriculum leadership system at GXNU. They play interactive roles in programme planning, implementation and evaluation to develop pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. This framework provided a general guide for the tools and parameters required for data collection and analysis in this study.</p>\n<p>According to the research questions, this study adopted a mixed-methods research approach, sequentially integrating a quantitative survey with qualitative interviews and documentation analysis. As pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-assessed perceptions of TPACK were likely to predict their ICT in education competencies, 211 pre-service teachers in the three programmes were surveyed to examine their TPACK perceptions. Valid data were analysed via statistical methods in SPSS 17.0. The interviewees included 13 curriculum leaders at the university, subordinate school and classroom levels, respectively, and 12 pre-service teachers were selected for focus group interviews. The qualitative data were analysed via open and axial coding. The findings from both methods were compared and combined.</p>\n<p>The integrated findings clarify the role of curriculum leaders in developing pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT in education competencies. Curriculum leaders at the university level (e.g., the Vice-President (Academic)) provide support in the forms of policy formulation and resource allocation. Curriculum leaders at the subordinate school level (e.g., the Vice-Dean (Academic)) have a significant effect on the application of ICT to education curriculum structures, course objectives and academic credit management. Furthermore, curriculum leaders at the classroom level (e.g., course coordinators or lecturers) have a significant effect on course content and pedagogy.</p>\n<p>The results of this study indicate the interactions between curriculum leadership and teacher education programmes. Curriculum leadership shapes teacher education programmes by providing supportive policies, planning or managing curricula and evaluating pre-service teachers&rsquo; learning outcomes. The programmes may also shape the practices of curriculum leaders in terms of the changing educational system requirements and current curricula constraints. This finding may help to provide empirical evidence and achieve an understanding of the effectiveness of teacher education programmes.</p>\n<p>This study also reveals that curriculum leaders are under pressure to acquire and use effective programme management strategies related to the use of ICT in education. In particular, this study highlights the importance of university senior management in supporting coordination and communication between curriculum leaders. This study also explains that pre-service teachers&rsquo; teaching reflections and evaluations are of great importance for improving courses or programmes and informing the practices of curriculum leaders.</p>\n<p>Beyond these findings, this study contributes to an important future direction for TPACK. It suggests that examining TPACK at the programme and course levels with a focus on curriculum leadership requires more research. The outcomes of the study are expected to expand the theoretical knowledge of curriculum leadership effects, especially in relation to the use of ICT in teacher education. The findings imply the need for consistent support, collaboration and commitment to programme improvement from all educational stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Finally, the limitations of the study are highlighted, including its generalisation and methodological limitations and its small sample of interviewed curriculum leaders and surveyed pre-service teachers.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to integrate GeoGebra technology to develop the TPACK of secondary school pre-service mathematics teachers. The participants of this study were 60 Indian teachers. Data were collected through the administration of pre-post TPACK surveys using a Google Online survey. Results from the survey revealed that there were changes in teachers&rsquo; TPACK after undergoing the Geogebra workshop. Practical implications are discussed regarding how to enhance pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK using GeoGebra in mathematics teaching.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Craciun, D., &amp; Bunoiu, M.

Proceedings of the 13th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education, 2, 352-359. doi:10.12753/2066-026X-17-135</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework used in the pre-service teacher training program requires new approaches to the effective integration of technology in science education, highlighting the intersection of the three main domains previously mentioned (technology, pedagogy and science content knowledge) in the training of prospective teachers. To develop the pre-service teacher&rsquo;s confidence in using TPACK we have chosen training activities built on web-based comics and mind/concept maps as our pedagogical methods. Web-based comics consist of fixed sequences of images and text created and viewed through dedicated online applications. In science education, comics represent a creative alternative to present and explain a concept, phenomenon and/or a situation. Visual methods such as concept cartoons or concept maps can be used for learning new concepts or systemizing information. We have opted for these methods since communicating scientific concepts and knowledge through visual representations and using web 2.0 applications and gadgets are feature which characterize the current generation of students. In this paper we describe the way in which pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the Teacher Training Program at the West University of Timisoar between the years 2014 and 2016, have acquired and evaluated TPACK while participating in the design, management and analysis of learning activities based on visual representations developed for compulsory education. Our study reveals that they consider the integration of web based comics in their teaching activities to be beneficial for presenting, explaining and assessing the concepts and phenomena taught in class, as well as for identifying and correcting misconceptions. Furthermore, our study shows that the future physics teachers have developed TPACK since an efficient integration of comics and mind maps assumes a more profound understanding of the relationship between technology, pedagogical knowledge and the scientific content taught in class.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>McKenna, K., Otieno, C., &amp; Schulz, L.

The TIM addressed preservice educators&rsquo; needs to develop awareness of, and abilities to, apply the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) Standards for Teachers and Students (ISTE, 2015). The TIM assisted preservice educators in connecting the ISTE standards to content standards and theories of teaching and learning by developing effective lessons. Through completion of TIMs, preservice educators not only connected ISTE standards and content standards, but also visualized the relationships to pedagogical models and theories. Findings from this study included an increase in preservice educators&rsquo; awareness of today&rsquo;s learners, ISTE standards, connections to pedagogy, and increased abilities to transform learning experiences.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>SITE</em></p>\n<p>Editors&rsquo; Note: Below are TPACK-related presentation links from the Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education (SITE) International Conference held in Austin, Texas in March 2017.</p>\n<p>Alabbasi, D.<br />Gamifying TPACK: The application of a design-based teaching strategy to enhance teachers&rsquo; intrinsic motivation toward effective technology integration</p>\n<p>Barber, A., Williams, D., &amp; Dolenc, N.<br />Preservice teacher inquiry cycles in a technology in education course: Emerging maker dispositions toward an inquiry stance for education</p>\n<p>Corven, J., &amp; Tomayko, M.<br />TPACK radar diagrams &ndash; A visual quantitative representation for tracking growth of essential teacher knowledge</p>\n<p>Di Blas, N., &amp; Paolini, P.<br />Distributed and dynamic TPACK as an educational approach</p>\n<p>Figg, C., &amp; Jaipal-Jamani, K.<br />Developing TPACK in higher education faculty: An eLearning mentor strategy</p>\n<p>Harris, L.<br />Investigating the effects of a technology integrated field experience on teaching using TPACK</p>\n<p>Hofer, M., &amp; Harris, J.<br />Differentiating TPACK-based learning materials for preservice and inservice teachers</p>\n<p>Kaplon-Schilis, A., &amp; Lyublinskaya, I.<br />Exploring independence of five TPACK domains TK, PK, CK math, CK science, and TPACK of pre-service special education teachers</p>\n<p>Kessler, A., Philips, M., Koehler, M., Mishra, P., Rosenberg, J., Schmidt-Crawford, D., Wang, W., Harris, J., Mouza, C., Mourlam, D., Foster, A., &amp; Shah, M.<br />The technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework: Lineages of the first ten years of research: Part 1</p>\n<p>MacKinnon, G.<br />The utility of TPACK in deconstructing the impact of an innovative STEM curriculum in a Chinese international school</p>\n<p>Mourlam, D., &amp; Bleecker, H.<br />Early career teacher candidate TPACK development: Implementation of a learning activity types short course</p>\n<p>Papendieck, A., Lune, N.

A framework for seeking the connections between technology, pedagogy, and culture: A study in the Maldives. Journal of Open, Flexible and Distance Learning, 21(1), 35-51. Retrieved from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318119664</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Educational technology researchers have often overlooked the effect of culture on teachers&rsquo; use of digital technologies in their pedagogical practice. Several technology integration models, such as the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK), have also failed to explain the connections between technology, pedagogy, and culture. This paper argues that teachers&rsquo; pedagogical and technological practices cannot be fully understood without considering the social and cultural norms of their specific cultures. An ethnographic methodology, linked to Bourdieu&rsquo;s (1977) habitus, is used to explore teacher educators&rsquo; practices in the Maldives. The author uses interviews, observations, focus groups, and the hanging-out approach to gather data from eleven teacher educators who work in a Maldivian university. Key findings demonstrate that teacher educators&rsquo; pedagogical and technological practices are influenced by their own culture, their early learning experiences in the Maldives, and their workplace (institutional context). Through this finding, the paper proposes a framework; namely, Pedagogical and Technological Cultural Habitus (PATCH), for understanding teachers&rsquo; pedagogical and technological habitus in various contexts. The PATCH framework provides a theoretical basis for designing technology-oriented professional development for professionals in various pedagogical contexts, including virtual and blended pedagogical spaces. It also contributes to the TPACK framework by adding an outer layer to its current theorisation to represent teachers&rsquo; backgrounds and habitus when examining their practices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Agrati, L.S.

An example for everyone is the thematic repository of digital educational content that can be used with active methodologies such as flipped classroom and inquiry-based learning (Bergmann &amp; Sams, 2012; Strayer, 2012; Huang &amp; Chiu, 2015). As suggested by the descriptive model of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge &ndash; TPCK (Harris, Mishra, &amp; Koehler, 2009; Koehler, Mishra, &amp; Yahya, 2007), all this requires the teacher to rethink the relationship with his knowledge and students themselves (Charlot, 1997, Vincent &amp; Carnus, 2015) as well as a new type of knowledge that specifically deals with the choice and use of digital content, their re-elaboration and protection from the legal point of view. The contribution, retrieving the reflections from the TPCK model, calls for a discus- sion on the type of technological knowledge required today to the teacher for a &lsquo;wise use&rsquo; (Jenkins, 2010, Ri- voltella, 2013) &ndash; but also an effective and &lsquo;legal&rsquo; &ndash; of digital resources. Through a case study &ndash; based on the analysis of a thematic repository in use in a High School of Bari province &ndash; will be highlighted, in their didactic implications, aspects such as the computer security, the intellectual property of digital resources by teachers and by others, the access/use by students.&rdquo;<br />Agustin, R.R., &amp; Lilisari, L.

Ten pre-service science teachers were involved in a semester long peer teaching program. Descriptive method was employed with the use of teaching artifacts, observation and self-reported survey for representing the way the participant integrate technology into their teaching. TPACK constructs were defined using relevant literature as frameworks. This study found that TPACK of pre-service science teachers were still low and is not sufficient for teaching science in junior high school. Furthermore, it is needed several supporting program to prepare pre-service science teachers&rsquo; competencies in teaching science with technology. In this case, more sophisticated peer teaching program with better purchase is necessity to improve TPACK competencies of pre-service science teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Arar, K., &amp; Abramovitz, R.

The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a framework that captures some of the essential qualities of the knowledge required by teachers for effective pedagogical practice in a technology-enhanced educational environment using technology and pedagogy content knowledge (TPACK). A TPACK Short and Quick (TPACK-SQ) survey questionnaire was used to explore and assess 244 in- and pre-service science and mathematics teachers in Kuwait. The results of the survey showed that in-service teachers needed help with some aspects of TPACK. Therefore, a workshop was developed and 57 in-service teachers were enrolled and trained based on the TPACK-SQ model. The results of posttests for their knowledge were significantly positive as against pretests. The workshop thus provides a rich example of how to support the implementation of essential elements of the TPACK-SQ model.&rdquo;<br />Baran, E., Canbazoglu Bilici, S., Albayrak Sari, A., &amp; Tondeur, J.

The research was conducted with 215 preservice teachers in the last year of teacher education programs and teaching certificate programs in three universities in Turkey. Data sources were the synthesis of qualitative evidence (SQD) scale that was validated in the Turkish context as part of this study and the TPACK-practical scale. The strategies investigated in the SQD-model included: using teacher educators as role models; reflecting on the role of technology in education; learning how to use technology by design; collaboration with peers; scaffolding authentic technology experiences; and providing continuous feedback. The linear regression analysis revealed a positive relation between teacher education strategies and preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK. Reflection and teacher educators&rsquo; as role models were the most frequently used teacher education strategies in teacher education programs included in this study. Results provided recommendations for further research on the connection between the teacher education strategies and the development of preservice teachers&rsquo; TPACK in teacher education programs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bull, G., Spector, J.

Critical inquiry in this aspect is timely as a new culture of learning is emerging from the informal contexts of learning and challenging how school-based learning should be designed to foster 21st century competencies. In this study, a survey instrument was developed to assess and investigate the relationships among pre-service teachers&rsquo; beliefs about the new culture of learning and school-based learning, their design dispositions, learning design practices and relevant factors of TPACK. Based on the sample size of 223 pre-service teachers in Singapore, the validation shows that the relevant factors pertaining to TPACK, teachers&rsquo; beliefs and design were distinctive. The study shows that teachers&rsquo; beliefs about learning and their design capacities changed along with their TPACK efficacy. It also identified factors that might affect teachers&rsquo; competencies needed to design lessons that could cultivate a new 21st century culture of learning. Implications of the relationships among teachers&rsquo; beliefs about learning, their design capacities and TPACK to foster 21st century competencies are discussed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ciptaningrum, D. S.

We used (a) a survey approach to examine international teachers&rsquo; perceived technology integration abilities using the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework and (b) a design task to understand their rationale behind technology integration decisions. As a group (N = 16), international teachers reported increased abilities in all TPACK domains. Qualitative analysis of their rationales revealed that though teachers learned to consider the affordances of technology, technology access issues were pivotal in their choice and use of technology in instruction planning. With education becoming increasingly global, the study has implications for the motivation and design of technology professional development programs for international teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Deng, F., Chai, C.S., So, H-J., Qian, Y., &amp; Chen, L.

Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33(3), 1-14. doi:10.14742/ajet.3508</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;While various quantitative measures for assessing teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) have developed rapidly, few studies to date have comprehensively validated the structure of TPACK through various criteria of validity especially for content specific areas. In this paper, we examined how the TPACK survey measure is aligned with the TPACK lesson plan measure and how they are related to the measure of epistemological beliefs about chemistry. The participants were 280 Chinese preservice chemistry teachers enrolled in a university in China. Both exploratory and confirmatory factory analyses were performed on the TPACK survey measure to help to establish validity, including considerations for convergent and discriminant validity. This was followed by the invariance test to examine factorial validity as related to gender. To establish the predictive validity of TPACK, the relationships among teachers&rsquo; epistemological beliefs, TPACK, and their capacity for planning technology-integrated lessons were also examined. Overall, the results showed that all four types of validity looked at in this study (i.e., convergent, discriminant, factorial, and predictive) were satisfactorily established. Implications for TPACK research and teacher education are also discussed.&rdquo;<br />De Rossi, M. (2017). Methodological demands, soft skill and ICT integration.

This contribution wants to offer some reflections about methodologies for academic education from a learner-centred perspective considering, among the other factors, ICT usage as a crucial issue. As it is widely acknowledged, it is not enough to act on the level of instrumental equipment or isolated dimensions of teachers&rsquo; knowledge. Instead, there is the need to foster advanced models aimed at realizing ICT integration in didactics in operative and procedural ways. Moreover, these models should go beyond the link among fundamental knowledge types (disciplinary, pedagogical, technological), to consider students&rsquo; characteristics (in terms of knowledges, hard and soft skills already owned and the ones to be enhanced), and also educational context (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2009).&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Farrell, I.K., &amp; Hamed, K.M.

Upon examination of VAM scores and teacher attributes, the subject area, the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at the teacher&rsquo;s school, and the grade level of the teacher were all significantly related to VAM scores. In addition, the TPACK survey results overall and its constructs were examined with teacher attributes. The significant relationships were gender, subject area, the number of certifications, highest degree held by the teacher, years teaching, and teaching in/out of area. The analysis showed no significant relationship between a teacher&rsquo;s VAM score and the TPACK survey overall or its individual constructs.&rdquo;<br />Harris, J., &amp; Hofer, M.

Perhaps inevitably, TPACK&rsquo;s enthusiastic reception and rapid dissemination have generated multiple points of divergence, which in turn need further study; especially the construct&rsquo;s accurate measurement and validation; how to assist preservice and in-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK development; contextual influences upon teachers&rsquo; TPACK; and the relationship of TPACK-based knowledge to teachers&rsquo; decision-making and action. Given the widespread diffusion of TPACK, research focusing on these and related issues will help to determine the direction of future post-secondary learning and teaching with technologies.

Based on this understanding we examine teachers&rsquo; reasoning in relation to the pedagogical choices teachers make while using ICT in practice. We argue that teachers&rsquo; reasoning about pedagogy elicits their technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK). Data from 29 video cases show how elementary teachers used ICT to facilitate specific pedagogical strategies (e.g., activating learning, classroom management, dealing with diversity, fostering learning strategies). Findings indicate that teachers used ICT mostly to promote activation of learning. Many teachers reasoned about using ICT for adapting their teaching to student needs, but this was seldom observed in practice. The few teachers who showed behaviour supporting adaptive teaching and fostering learning strategies almost always used ICT to facilitate these pedagogical strategies. We argue that for effective teaching with ICT it is important that teachers learn to reason explicitly about how ICT can support specific pedagogical strategies. The results from this study provide suggestions for what is needed in teacher education programs and professional development initiatives to support teachers in acquiring TPK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hunter, J.

High Possibility Classrooms (HPC) is a pedagogical framework drawn from research on exemplary teachers&rsquo; knowledge of technology integration in Australian school classrooms. The framework is being used to support teachers who teach various stages of schooling to take &lsquo;pedagogical steps&rsquo; in their practice with technology. This article focuses on the use of the HPC conceptual framework in a study of seven teachers and their students at two secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Analysis confirms the practicality of this conceptual framework for technology integration in secondary school classrooms. This inquiry has implications for addressing the reluctance of teachers to integrate technology in curriculum. The article concludes by suggesting that more schools might consider using conceptual frameworks like HPC to support secondary school teachers to enhance student learning with technology.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Incik, E., &amp; Akay, C.

The quantitative data were collected through Technopedagogical Education Competency (Tpack-Deep) Scale and Technology Perception Scale and the qualitative data were collected with an open ended-question form. It was concluded that pre-service teachers generally regard themselves at a moderate level in the sense of technopedogogical education competency, have positive perception towards technology and there is a positive correlation between pre-service teachers&rsquo; technopedogogical educational competency and perception towards technology. According to results of qualitative analysis of the study, pre-service teachers think that educational technologies have contributions to preparing information-communication technologies based upon presentations, developing technology-based materials, preparing homework, doing research, raising awareness about the importance of educational technology use in the learning and teaching process, acquiring information about their department, developing skill of using technology based on information-communication technologies and having positive attitude.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Karatas, I., Tunc, M.P., Yilmaz, N., &amp; Karaci, G.

In this study, TPACK Survey, TPACK Self-Confidence<br />Survey, and TPACK Perception Survey were administered to 427 pre-service middle school mathematics teachers in elementary mathematics education program. The data were analyzed quantitatively. The data analysis revealed that there was a significant relationship between gender and perception towards technology. Moreover, it might be concluded that pre-service teachers improve their knowledge and self confidence to use technology in elementary mathematics education programs. Lastly, considering the finding that there was a relationship between the use of technology and self-confidence towards the use of technology, it might<br />be inferred that self-confidence of pre-service teachers towards the use of educational technologies increases with the use instructional tools.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lin, C-H., Liu, H., &amp; Hu, Y.

This qualitative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative research addressed trends and gaps in the literature related to technology and Chinese-language teacher education. The three main strands of research covered were 1) technology standards in Chinese-language teacher education, 2) the actual application of technology in such education, and 3) factors predicting Chinese-language teachers&rsquo; technology adoption. Three major findings emerged. First, technology standards need to recognize an urgent need to agree upon and teach specific sets of skills, as theorized in frameworks such as Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK). Second, while consistent improvements in Chinese-language teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge and technological-pedagogical knowledge have been reported, three other key components &ndash; i.e., training, practice and reflection &ndash; need to be better integrated into their teacher-training models. Third, two external factors (resources and support) and three internal factors (pedagogical beliefs, technology knowledge and demographics) emerged as crucial to technology integration among these teachers.

Besides the skills for how to teach subjects effectively, teachers should also know how to integrate digital technology into their teaching. Several studies have been done based on the TPACK framework. Some of these studies use this framework for specific subject domains. In this study a generally applicable instrument for measuring TPACK was created. The aim of the paper was to validate the created instrument and to find out how pre-service teachers perceive their technological, pedagogical and content knowledge regarding the TPACK framework in Estonia, in a technologically highly developed country where technology is broadly used in general education. Conducting factor analysis all items with technology merged into one factor meaning that young generation perceives technology already integrated with content and pedagogy. The results indicate that pre-service teachers lack pedagogical knowledge, but they perceive that they are good at integrating technology into their teaching. Differences in perceptions were also found according to gender, age and curricula.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mourlam, D. (2017). Preparing for infusion: Emergence of a model for faculty TPACK development.

Retrieved from https://www.learntechlib.org/p/177836/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;As technologies have become ubiquitous in society and within higher education, institutions have begun to invest in the development of faculty to leverage digital technologies during their instruction. This has been especially true in teacher education programs where standalone educational technology courses have been eliminated in favor of an infusion model where candidate TPACK development occurs throughout the entire teacher education program of study. However, faculty development experiences do not always support the development of faculty knowledge in ways that support the dynamic interactions among content, pedagogy, and technologies that is needed to effectively teach with digital tools. In response to this gap in the field, using a mixed method approach this study sought to characterize a faculty development experience grounded in both TPACK and adult learning theory that was guided by a faculty developer. Findings suggest faculty found value in the ongoing nature of the development experience, and valued faculty developer support in meeting their goals. Findings also indicated that both participating faculty and teacher education candidates enrolled in their courses both had increases in their TPACK.

In such a context, a challenging issue is the content and structure of appropriate activities for cultivating various types of synthetic knowledge combining technology, pedagogy and content through asynchronous collaboration. In this paper, we elaborate on the social orchestration of a training course around collaborative design activities and on the emerging challenges from two successive cycles of implementation. We highlight the elements used to expand and augment online interaction, drawn from two known approaches in teacher training and online learning, the TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge) framework and the CoI (Community of Inquiry) model. We specifically examine a) the impact of synthetic design activities to the development of pre-service teachers&rsquo; synthetic knowledge (of Technology, Pedagogy and Content) and b) the relationships among specific elements of TPACK and CoI. Findings drawn from the examination of pre-service teachers&rsquo; perspectives through two structured questionnaires reveal important potential of synthetic activities for teachers&rsquo; TPACK development and highlight specific connections among elements of the TPACK and CoI frameworks.</p>\n<p>Poitras, E.G., Doleck, T., Huang, L., Li, S., Lajoie, S.P.

Case examples of data mining techniques are presented that allow the discovery of knowledge regarding pre-service teachers&rsquo; information-seeking and acquisition behaviours and how to support them. The first case illustrates the use of simulated learner experiments, while the second involves the creation of a model to detect learner behaviours.

The findings show that despite having sound pedagogy and teaching qualifications, participants could not successfully utilize their skills to incorporate technology effectively in their teaching. Institutional policies regarding technology integration and complex pacing guide which directed learning objectives and course materials could not give teachers the freedom to integrate learned skills in class, thus, the trainings provided to them became ineffective.

Researchers focused on the Catholic educational environment to develop a more refined understanding of specific, and unique, contextual factors within the TPACK framework. Individual case analysis of interview and observation data pointed toward microlevel, or teacher-centric, factors, including background, attitudes, and personal conceptualization of contemporary education, to be primary influences of the development and use of technological knowledge.

The main issue discovered in this study is the misconception in using technology for teaching and learning computer programming. Besides that, there were two major challenges found in this study. The challenges are the instructors were not able to explore the rapid development of technology and this may cause the lack of technological pedagogical knowledge among them. They also showed the lack of knowledge about pedagogy and assessment for teaching and learning computer programming that relevant to the programming content. The research that has been done showed that TPACK model is very suitable to guide exploration about how educators make use of technology appropriate to the pedagogy and content. However, the exploration that has been done has limitation on how educators integrate student&rsquo;s assessment on affective and instructional design implementation with TPACK.

A comprehensive analysis of the current challenges faced by practical curriculums on economic management is presented in this paper. A curriculum design model was constructed based on the TPACK theoretic framework and the constructivism learning theory. The curriculum &lsquo;Enterprise Operation and Decision Simulation System&rsquo; was taken as an example, and the practical curriculum system for economic management under the TPACK framework was designed from three aspects, namely, teaching content, teaching methodology, and teaching technique. On this basis, an econometric analysis software was used to analyze the effects of curriculum implementation. Research indicates that TPACK plays a significant role in improving teaching quality, elevating student satisfaction, and cultivating students&rsquo; professional application and practice abilities.

A comprehensive investigation of TPACK within pre-service teachers&rsquo; ICT profiles: Mind the gap! Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33(3), 46-60. doi:10.14742/ajet.3504</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study aims to identify profiles of pre-service teachers in order to explore their readiness to integrate technology in education. The assumption is that pre-service teacher characteristics such as technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), go together with the influence of their teacher training. Specifically, this study examines whether pre-service teachers can be clustered on the basis of their TPACK, a typical set of ICT-related characteristics (e.g., general ICT attitudes, attitudes towards ICT in education, ease of use, ICT self-efficacy), and the perceived support at their training institution to adequately integrate ICT in education. Data were collected from a sample of 688 last-year pre-service teachers in 18 teacher training institutions in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). Using correlational and latent profile analysis, the results suggest that: (1) two profiles can be distinguished, (2) TPACK and other individual ICT-related characteristics are positively correlated, and (3) pre-service teachers in a profile with strong TPACK, attitudes, and self-efficacy scores also report high scores on the support they perceive at their teacher training institution. Implications for the role of teacher training institutions are discussed with a specific focus on how to close the gap between the two identified profiles.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Turgut, Y. (2017).

To address this challenge, many TEIs have included introductory ICT courses in their curriculum to develop technological knowledge and skills. Although several existing studies have focused on detecting whether a course or a short-term training program can make an improvement on PTs&rsquo; TPACK, none of the existing studies have attempted to investigate in a longitudinal process whether PTs&rsquo; perceived development of TPACK skills follow an increasing linear pattern through years as planned in four-year-long teacher education programs, especially in ELT. This study therefore intends to address this gap in the literature. Based on TPACK survey with open-ended questions, results of the study indicated a nonlinear pattern of TPACK development over time. In line with these findings, suggestions for teacher educators, policy-makers, and future research were made.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Urbina, A. &amp; Polly, D. (2017).

Following a series of classroom observations and interviews, inductive qualitative analyses of data indicated that teachers felt that technology supported students&rsquo; mathematics learning and prepared them for their future where technology was important. However, observations indicated that despite teaching in one-to-one environments, students only used technology on rare occasions or if they finished activities early. Further, these technology-based activities were low-level review of mathematics computations.

Australasia<br />Journal of Educational Technology, 33(3), 15-31. doi:10.14742/ajet.3518</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Twenty-first century skills have attracted significant attention in recent years. Student of today and the future are expected to have the skills necessary for collaborating, problem solving, creative and innovative thinking, and the ability to take advantage of information and communication technology (ICT) applications. Teachers must be familiar with various pedagogical approaches and the appropriate ways to use ICT to support the development of their students&rsquo; twenty-first century skills. The technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework provides a theoretical model for studying the ways in which teachers use ICT in education. Still, the TPACK framework faces certain difficulties, especially concerning the instruments currently used for studying TPACK. These challenges are primarily related to the psychometric properties of the instruments and areas of pedagogical knowledge. Within this paper we introduce a new TPACK questionnaire, the TPACK-21 questionnaire which is grounded on twenty-first century skills. The TPACK-21 questionnaire is validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results provide a six factor CFA model aligning with the TPACK theoretical framework. Also, the associations among TPACK sub-constructs, and the weak and strong areas of pre-service teachers&rsquo; TPACK will be discussed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Willermark, S. (2017).

Yet, the framework has been criticized for not being practically useful, due to inaccurate and insufficient definitions. To better understand the critics and the usefulness of the framework, an investigation of how the framework has been applied to show teacher TPACK is needed. This study is a systematic literature review of 107 peer-reviewed journal articles concerning the use of TPACK in empirical studies published from 2011 to 2016. The study supplements previous review studies with more recent work on general characteristics of TPACK studies as well as contributes an analysis of how the framework has been applied to identify teacher TPACK in recent literature. Findings show a variety of approaches and instruments to examine teacher TPACK. Most common is to identify teacher TPACK via self-reporting, while performance evaluations of teaching activities are rare. Additionally, the ways TPACK is operationalized as a measuring instrument are often implicit and make comparison of results difficult. Future directions for research are discussed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yenmez, A. A. (2017). An examination of the effectiveness of instruction in which pre-service mathematics teachers use technology to overcome student difficulties. Journal of Education and Practice, 8(5), 1-21. Retrieved from https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1143989</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is seen that students face certain difficulties when learning the concepts and the relationships between them in the mathematics education that aims at enabling students to learn on the highest level. Identifying and eliminating these difficulties, helping students in the learning process and guiding them are among teachers&rsquo; tasks. Overcoming the difficulties experienced by students is considered one of the contributions of the technological use to the mathematics education. Yet, the efficient use of information and communication technologies in overcoming student difficulties is possible through bringing teachers and pre-service teachers in basic knowledge and skills. To this end, the effectiveness of the instruction in which pre-service teachers benefit from information and communication technologies to overcome the difficulties regarding a given concept was investigated. The participants were 32 third-year pre-service teachers attending at the elementary mathematics education of a state university. The effectiveness of pre-service teachers&rsquo; micro-instructions and their opinions on the role and effect of technology in their instructions were analyzed within the framework of specified themes. The instructional plans, observation sheets, self-evaluations, and the inventory of the interviews performed in regard to self-evaluations which affected the change in the process were analyzed with the content analysis. Consequently, the findings obtained in the study showed how the pre-service teachers performed effective instructions and revealed the positive change in their perspectives, possible means that technologies can offer to students in the mathematics education, and their positive contributions to their own learning. As for the components and recommendations of this pre-service educational program, it will be effective in the planning of instructional process in future studies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yenmez, A.A., Ozpinar, I., &amp; Gokce, S.

Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to observe changes in preservice teachers&rsquo; TPCK from their microteaching practices conducted under a conceptual TPCK framework. The participants are 52 third-year preservice teachers. An analysis was performed based on specific themes from the application, which had been developed to reveal the changes in preservice teachers&rsquo; conceptual framework of TPCK components. Content analysis was used to analyze the observation forms, self-evaluations, and transcriptions from the interviews on the self-evaluations for the effects over their procedural changes within the context of the themes. The study&rsquo;s findings indicate that preservice teachers use the technological tools to attain what they had specified in their instructional plans.

While the universe of the study is comprised of a total of 187 senior pre-service teachers attending the Department of Classroom Teacher Education in Mugla Sıtkı Kocman University in 2014-2015 academic year, the sampling consists of 141 pre-service teachers selected through the random sampling method from among the universe. The reason for selecting the senior students for the universe of the study was that they had already taken the subject-area, pedagogical and general culture courses. In the collection of the research data, The Techno Pedagogical Competency Scale and Epistemological Belief Scale and a personal information form were used. The data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS 21.0 program package. During the analysis process, first it was tested whether the data display a normal distribution and after it was determined that the data show a normal distribution, from among the descriptive statistics, t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to reveal the differences and Pearson-product Moment Correlation Coefficient analysis was used to elicit the correlations. The analyses revealed that the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; level of techno pedagogical competencies is high and their level of epistemological beliefs is medium. Gender and academic grade point average were found to be not leading to significant differences in their techno pedagogical subject-area competencies. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation was found between the pre-service classroom teachers&rsquo; techno pedagogical subject-area competencies and epistemological beliefs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zainuddin, N., &amp; Idrus, R.M.

Saudi Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 2(4), 344-347. doi:10.21276/sjhss</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Open and Flexible Learning is an excellent method of reaching all types of learners. It is truly a medium that helps to democratize education to all. Today, we are currently experiencing a time of constant evolution in the field of education in which students require more resources and tools to obtain the information and construction of knowledge. One such resource is the use of open and distance learning environment, where the lecturer assigns additional activities for the understanding of the concepts seen before. But there are times when the student does not understand the content because of the form it represents, making it necessary to have more options to facilitate the understanding of content through different ways that may be more attractive to the students, achieving more active participation in the subject and an affinity that leads to a better learning experience. This is the goal of the study, which proposes a model called &ldquo;Learning Buffet Model&rdquo; for designing Open and Flexible Learning content adaptable to the student ́s learning style. This learning buffet model can be used as a fundamental model and applied in any area or discipline of education as it forces the consideration of four components (leaning style, content, pedagogy and technology) in the design of the lesson plan and subsequently enrich the learning environment with more specific learning objects the subjects taught.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Zhou, Y., Chai, C.S., Liang, J-C., Jin, M., &amp; Tsai, C-C.

Consequently, teachers need to provide sufficient and relevant guidance for such homework. Teachers&rsquo; online homework guidance (TOHG) is conceptually connected with their level of technological pedagogical content knowledge about educational use of Web (TPACK-W). This study employed two questionnaires: a self-developed questionnaire for TOHG and a revised TPACK-W questionnaire to study how TOHG is associated with TPACK-W through correlation and regression analysis. Two hundred and eighty-four teacher participants from China who had experience in assigning online homework were asked to complete the questionnaires. This study validated the questionnaires and established significant relationship between the TOHG and TPACK-W. The study expanded current understanding of TPACK through the factors associated with online homework. The findings showed that the level of teachers&rsquo; online homework guidance was significantly related to their TPACK-W, and the two factors of Web-Pedagogical Knowledge and Web-Pedagogical-Content Knowledge in the TPACK-W questionnaire could predict the TOHG. Future teachers&rsquo; professional development for the construction of TPACK-W should include discussions and guidelines of online homework.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Chapters</em></p>\n<p>Bower, M.

A mixed methodology involved thirty 3rd year students and 14 teachers in the department of English in the process of data collection. Two sets of questionnaires were distributed among the teachers and students to examine their use, attitudes and reasons for which they might not use technology in teaching and learning as well as the way the teachers integrate technology. Interviews were set with two literature teachers to detect the problems encountered when teaching literature, in addition to an interview with the head of the department to provide a general idea about the situation of technology integration in teaching in the department. A classroom observation rubric was utilized, examining three literature lectures, to highlight the techniques used by teachers in teaching literature. A case study involved the thirty students in an investigation of the impact of technology on teaching and learning literature. The findings concluded that technology has a positive impact on the teaching and learning process. However, literature teachers use traditional techniques when teaching literature though results indicated the teachers&rsquo; as well as the students&rsquo; high positive attitudes towards using technology. Nevertheless, the students&rsquo; use of technology is higher than that of their teachers&rsquo; in the department. Therefore, the research suggested that the literature syllabus should be rewritten adopting more innovative techniques in teaching. It also suggested that the Department of English should consider providing the necessary equipment as well as teacher training programs to ameliorate the teaching and learning situation and to enable both teachers and students to cope up with the requirements of the 21st century rapidly changing world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Alcoser, M.

(UMI No. 10275103)</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This self-study examines the planning, practices, policies, and procedures present in a blended learning classroom environment to develop academic writing with tenth and eleventh grade public high school students. Digital technology is a prevalent and powerful force intertwined with most aspects of the human experience in the twenty-first century. As school systems, educators, and teacher educators try to respond to and within this rapidly evolving climate, they are confronted with challenges on many fronts, including infrastructure, professional development, teaching practice, policy, and further compounded by fiscal limitations. This effort is additionally challenged by a high-stakes testing climate in which state exam scores are used to evaluate the performance of the student, teacher, school, district, and state levels. Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is the frame predominantly used in academic literature to articulate, explore, and understand the aspects in play in the 21st-century classroom. Two practices implemented with digital tools to support academic writing development, discussion boards and digital document submissions/revisions were studied. Digital document submission/revision was found to have a positive relationship with fostering improved attitudes towards revision and about students&rsquo; own writing efficacy. This practice was most successful when classroom policies were modified to account for the shift in the nature of the task and its role in student learning. This self-study suggests a fourth dimension of knowledge is necessary to understand and implement digital technology in the classroom. Organizational knowledge (OK) includes: classroom policies, the arrangement of physical and virtual spaces, and classroom management in physical and virtual spaces. Technological Organizational Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TOPACK) would integrate OK into the framework, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of what teachers need to know when implementing instructional technology in their classrooms. While some have included classroom management under the pedagogical knowledge branch of TPACK, I suggest that this fails to acknowledge the larger OK needed beyond the knowledge of how best to teach and is a limited perception of the purpose of classroom management. Navigating institutional and procedural considerations also impact classroom operations. Additional research is needed in the area of OK and how its components are impacted by the inclusion of digital technologies in the 21st-century classroom and to confirm the findings.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cross, A.

While Makerspaces have been studied abundantly in museums, libraries, and in after-school programs, little research has been conducted inside the K- 12 school day. The goal of this study is to discover insights of established Makerspaces inside the K-12 school environment. In this exploratory mixed methods study, educators were survived, examining school and participant demographics, Makerspace setup, as well as intersections of technology, content and pedagogy. Next the researcher conducted a follow-up interview with selected participants based on diversity in the following key demographic areas: teacher gender, professional background, and school environment. In order to better understand K-12 implementation of Makerspaces, the study examines seven characteristics of Makerspaces: setting, computational thinking, participant structures, teacher training, gender and racial issues, assessment, and sustainability.

Participants in this research study were solicited based on their enrollment in the selected teacher preparation program within the last 5 years; also included were current seniors enrolled in their final semester before degree completion. This research study contains a sample size of 20 participants from a small, private university in western North Carolina. All of the participants were preservice teachers either presently employed in a public education setting after graduation or currently enrolled in the teacher preparation program at the university; and all sought or are seeking certification in grades kindergarten through twelfth grade. Like many other teacher preparation programs across the United States, this university focuses on continued improvement in preparing preservice teachers to enter future classrooms equipped with technology as part of the learning environment. Three questions were addressed in this study: (1) To what extent does the teacher preparation program adequately prepare the preservice teachers to integrate technology in their classroom pedagogical practices? (2) To what extent does modeling by instructors influence the disposition preservice teachers have towards integrating technology into their classroom practice? (3) To what extent does technology knowledge play a role in the preservice teacher&rsquo;s confidence towards technology integration? A mixed-methods research design was used to explore the preparation of preservice teachers who received their training at a small, private, western North Carolina university. The Survey of Pre-service Teachers&rsquo; Knowledge of Teaching and Technology (Schmidt et al., 2009) was used to gather both quantitative as well as qualitative data pertaining to the participants. The quantitative data gathered were analyzed by grouping 5-point Likert-scale responses into positive and negative responses using percentages to identify overall perceptions based on the seven domains of Mishra and Koehler&rsquo;s (2006) TPACK framework. Additionally, the researcher utilized the qualitative responses given by participants from the open-ended questions at the end of the survey as well as during a focus group to strengthen the quantitative data and formulate answers to the posed research questions. Each set of data was analyzed separately, which allowed for triangulation (Creswell, 2009). The positive results produced by the survey results and focus-group responses conveyed how preservice teachers perceive they have been prepared to effectively integrate technology in their classroom lessons; however, the researcher recommends further research into preservice teachers&rsquo; capacity to integrate technology through continuous assessment and reflection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Green, W.L.

A sample of 252 educators from a rural Georgia school district completed a 50- question TPACK survey. The survey data were used as input for k-means cluster analysis, which yielded three teacher profiles: a) High-TPACK, b) Mid-TPACK, and c) Low-TPACK. Demographic data of educators, years of experience, level of education, age, were tabulated by cluster. Results showed that the High-TPACK cluster (N=96) were made up of typically younger teachers, and predominately male. The Mid-TPACK (N=143) cluster skewed older with a majority of female educators. The Low-TPACK cluster (N=14) was made up of educators towards the end of their careers. A chi-square test showed that levels of student achievement differed significantly across the three clusters with a score of &chi;2(8)= 15.851 with p=.045 due to more students performing at a higher level on standardized assessment from the High-TPACK Cluster. Further, a t-test showed that the average percentage of students meeting and exceeding standards was significantly higher in the High-TPACK cluster than in the Mid-TPACK cluster (t(97)=-3.045, p=.004).</p>\n<p>These results indicate that teachers with higher levels of TPACK have students who perform better on standardized assessment. These teachers&rsquo; types consisted of teachers that skewed younger and were more willing to take risks to explore technology integration. Suggestions were made for teacher preparation programs as well as professional development to target skills needed to get all teachers to the level of High-TPACK.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hallikainen, C.

Teacher education&rsquo;s task is to prepare pre-service teachers to confront these challenges and guide them to make use of the new digital learning environments. By studying pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical knowledge one can find out what kind of guidance do pre-service teachers need to work as an innovative in-service teacher. This thesis discusses lesson plans made by pre-service primary teachers from the perspective of technological pedagogical content knowledge. Theories of conceptions of teaching and learning, the national core curriculum for basic education implemented in fall 2016, previous research in educational technology and visions of future technology are also taken in to account as underlying theories. The data consists of 60 lesson plans, which included 238 different teaching activities. Qualitative content analysis was used to determine technological and pedagogical knowledge in the activities. Pedagogical knowledge was described through used teaching methods as conceptions of teaching and learning. Technological knowledge was described through the devices and software used. Technological pedagogical knowledge is combined from the results of TK and PK with ATLAS.ti software. The most often mentioned technologies in the lesson plans were tablets and office tools. It appears that pre-service teacher planned to use more student-centered activities than teacher-centered activities. Teaching methods used by pre-service teacher seemed to be mostly congruent with the core curriculum. Based on the results it appears that pre-service teachers were able to plan instructions with common educational ICT tools, but there were still some areas of improvement on pre-service teachers&rsquo; technological pedagogical content knowledge. The results and previous studies suggest that teacher education should encourage pre-service teacher to make use of the new innovative technologies. Teacher education should also help pre-service teachers to find suitable pedagogical solutions through practical experience.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hooker, M. (2017). A study on the implementation of the strengthening innovation and practice in secondary education initiative for the preparation of science, technology, English, and mathematics (STEM) teachers in Kenya to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) in teaching and learning (Doctoral dissertation, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK).

The aim of this research study was to critically appraise the innovation model in relation to teacher development for ICT use in classroom practice associated with the SIPSE project over two cycles of the pilot phase implementation. The model integrated an ICT Competency Framework for Teachers (ICT-CFT) and Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) frameworks into a phased modular approach (ICT-CFT-TPACK-in-practice) for teacher professional development. The research addressed key questions related to: the object of ICT use as perceived by head teachers and teachers; and the characteristics of teacher design for ICT use in STEM teaching and learning as evidenced in classroom activities at different stages of their professional learning journey in the SIPSE intervention. The study used a qualitative design basedresearch (DBR) methodology that was enhanced with the use of a &lsquo;TPACKtivity&rsquo; lens combining TPACK and Activity Theory (AT) to explore, explicate and communicate the findings. The study was conducted with a purposive sample of twenty-four teachers, four head teachers and four schools drawn from the wider SIPSE programme intervention. The research data was collected over three field visits carried out between September 2014 and February 2016. The qualitative research methods included individual interviews and focus group discussions with the teachers and the head teachers. Data were also drawn from documentation of lesson plans and peer-to-peer lesson observations. The findings were illuminating. They presented participant accounts of tensions and dissonances with the introduction of technology into their school and classroom practices that reflected similar issues revealed in the literature. However, the findings elucidated some nuanced shifts and unexpected teacher design narratives for technology use to support, improve and innovate STEM teaching and learning processes. They further revealed the importance of classroom processes as the centre stage for fostering teacher collective and continual design conversations for framing and reframing ICT use solutions appropriate to the affordances and realities of their classroom and school contexts. In this the findings contribute to the current discourse by offering a TPACKtivity framework centred on authentic classroom settings as a basis for developing and appraising models of professional development for ICT use that can inform practice, policy and research.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Janssen, N.

This dissertation investigated the design and effectiveness of supplementary information to assist pre-service teachers during the lesson planning process. Based on the Technological, Pedagogical, And Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, several sets of support materials were developed. All materials contained information about technology, pedagogy, and content, but differed with regard to how these types of information were organized. Some materials presented each type of information in a separate section whereas other materials used an integrated format in which multiple types of information were combined. These different configurations were compared in four experimental studies. The main findings indicate that pre-service teachers prefer and benefit most from integrated support when thinking about the use of technology in their lessons. However, additional support or sustained practice seems needed to ensure high-quality technology integration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lavadia, L. (2017).

(UMI No. 10280318)</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Earlier studies concluded that technology&rsquo;s strength is in supporting student learning rather than as an instrument for content delivery (Angeli &amp; Valanides, 2014). Current research espouses the merits of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework as a guide for educators&rsquo; reflections about technology integration within the context of content and instructional practice. Grounded by two theoretical frameworks, TPACK (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006; 2008) and Rogers&rsquo; (1983, 1995) theory of diffusion of innovation, the purpose of this mixed-methods research was two-fold: to explore the perceived competencies of tertiary science faculty at higher education institutions with respect to their integration of technology within the constructs of pedagogical practice and content learning and to analyze whether these perceived competencies may serve as predictive factors for technology adoption level. The literature review included past research that served as models for the Sci-TPACK instrument. Twenty-nine professors of tertiary science courses participated in an online Likert survey, and four professors provided in-depth interviews on their TPACK practices. Quantitative analysis of data consisted of descriptive and reliability statistics, calculations of means for each of the seven scales or domains of TPACK, and regression analysis. Open-ended questions on the Likert survey and individual interviews provided recurrent themes of the qualitative data. Final results revealed that the participants integrate technology into pedagogy and content through a myriad of TPACK practices. Regression analysis supported perceived TPACK competencies as predictive factors for technology adoption level.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Malkoc, U. (2017).

It was conducted in multiple classrooms in one school and with science teachers. It included a self-study component. It provided an opportunity to directly observe the interactions between students and teacher as distinct species in the classroom when technology integration occurred.

Retrieved from<br />http://nsuworks.nova.edu/gscis_etd/1013/.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;It is inevitable that campus-based higher education will adopt some form of a hybrid learning approach. For schools and their faculty members, this means the acknowledgment and acceptance of these changes are required. Campus-based higher education faculty members wish to change how they teach courses due to societal demands to better suit the next generation of students. Initially, schools began offering new technology to faculty that wished to use the technology; however, over the years, due to the demands of competition with other schools and next generation, tech-savvy students entering academia, schools are starting to require the use of technology that was once only an option for faculty members. This implementation of incorporating technology into the classroom has faced several roadblocks because what was once considered a simple transition has become more complex due to faculty resistance to new technology, which stems from various limitations, barriers, and perceptions, such as low computer self-efficacy, high computer anxiety, and time to learn new technology. The purpose of this study was to understand how in-service faculty experience individualized training as a method of teaching faculty how to use the technology and integrate it into their courses. The lived experiences and perceptions of in-service faculty regarding individualized training were specifically focused on to determine how individualized instruction was perceived to help or hinder integrating technology into their courses. The focus was the experience Harper College and McLennan Community College&rsquo;s in-service faculty, who experienced training through the group training currently offered by the schools, as well as the proposed individualized training. Higher education faculty from general study areas, such as English, math, and science were invited to participate. The study consisted of a 6-week individualized training program for 12 in-service faculty members (seven completed the study) who previously participated in a group training program about Blackboard. The study was a phenomenological approach in that used interviews to gather information regarding the lived experiences as the basis of analysis. The data for this study were gathered, horizonalized, and analyzed through a 7-step data processing method for phenomenology studies. After the data were analyzed, the findings show how developing a good individualized training program can help in-service faculty members not only integrate technology into their course designs but address any of the limitations or barriers the faculty faced. These findings coincide with the recommendations that training programs need to be developed into a phased approach in which the existing group training should continue but a secondary training program should be developed that incorporates andragogy-based principles and the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Miller, S.B. (2017). Teachers&rsquo; use of instructional moves during technology-based mathematical activities (Doctoral dissertation). Available from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global database (UMI No. 10270262).</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigates instructional moves by teachers in mathematics classrooms in which technology-based activities (i.e., student-oriented simulations) and features of those simulations influence classroom practices. Four teachers were studied over the course of a year as an exploratory study to build interpretive cases that described instructional practices in technology- based lessons. Teachers developed lessons using PhET simulations designed to support algebraic reasoning. Data sources included teachers&rsquo; process of selecting and designing lessons, observations of teachers&rsquo; non-technology and technology-based mathematical activities, and teacher interviews and reflections. This work was based on a conceptual framework blending the ideas of Mathematical Tasks (Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 1998), Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006), in which teachers&rsquo; instructional practices are determined by teachers&rsquo; mathematical pedagogical content knowledge, task selection and design, and use of technology. Results indicated that teachers see simulations as having significant benefits in the classroom. Teachers leveraged these opportunities by increasing class discussions, engaging in higher levels of thinking and reasoning, and focusing on mathematical representations. When teachers used simulations, the teachers spent less time in direct instruction, focused more on the mathematics, and focused more on investigations rather than drill-oriented tasks. Technology in the classroom, however, was problematic for some teachers. The very nature of students working independently with their own devices meant that student-student interactions decreased in some lessons. Furthermore, teachers&rsquo; discomfort in managing technology seems to limit ongoing use.<br />Specific features of the simulations that prompted instructional moves included the ability to support conceptual understanding and build student engagement. Simulations also provided a &lsquo;low floor, high ceiling,&rsquo; supporting differentiation, and a dynamic responsiveness, facilitating connections between representations. On the other hand, teachers raised concerns that some features of the simulation could do the math for the students. Furthermore, the perception of simulations as being a game may impact how and when simulations are used.<br />The emergent use of technology in math classrooms is under-supported. For simulations to be used in a more extensive fashion in mathematics classes, professional development and curricular materials are needed to support implementation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mohamed, M. E. I.

Retrieved from https://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/35229</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;This study investigated the conditions for developing science teachers&rsquo; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). It also explored the opportunities offered by two strategies to enhance science teachers&rsquo; ability to design technology-based inquiry activities for science learning: Experiencing Inquiry Model (EIM) and Metacognitive Scaffolding (MS). These strategies were adopted to support the processing necessary for developing teachers&rsquo; knowledge and for negotiating the integration of computer technology in science instruction. Situated Cognition Theory was used as a theoretical framework for learning, and TPACK was used as a conceptual framework for technology integration. 33 science teachers from four intermediate and high schools participated in the study. 17 and 16 teachers were conveniently assigned to EIM and MS, respectively. The study employed a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative evidence. As per the quantitative method, a quasi-experimental design that employed the 2 Teaching Strategy (EIM or MS) &times; 2 Time (pre- and post-intervention) of learning split-plot factorial design was applied in the study. Concurrently with the quantitative data collection, the qualitative evidence was collected from the researcher&rsquo;s logbook, participants&rsquo; written documents, and interviews. The findings suggested that there were no significant differences between EIM and MS for developing the knowledge components embodied in TPACK. Nevertheless, the participants who learned through the MS strategy outperformed their counterparts in designing technology-based inquiry activities for science learning. The latter result suggested that teachers who received metacognitive scaffolding were more equipped to connect curriculum goals with technology and instruction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Montes, S. T. (2016). Integrating one-to-one technology in the classroom: Three different approaches (Doctoral dissertation). Retrieved from https://uh-ir.tdl.org/uh-ir/handle/10657/1723?show=full</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this qualitative, multiple case study was to examine the decisions three teachers made while planning to integrate portable technology in technology-rich elementary classrooms. The three participants were selected by their district&rsquo;s Digital Learning Coordinator because of their high level of technology integration. The study investigated these teachers&rsquo; planning habits for instruction incorporating portable technology, such as Chromebooks. Observations, interviews, and lesson plan reviews constituted the qualitative data collected during approximately eight weeks. Peer debriefing, along with member checks, guaranteed that themes did not have a limited point of view, establishing credibility and dependability (Anney, 2014, Carspecken, 1996; Day, 2015). The Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) model was a useful descriptor for each teacher&rsquo;s technology planning level, and each used their own level of TPACK to drive their integration of technology in their classrooms and in their planning. The three participants utilized one-to-one (1:1) technology with varying degrees of effectiveness, and each planned differently for its use. The cross-case analysis guided the formation of four assertions: a) Experienced teachers with technology at their disposal are unlikely to change their planning, but will simply include technology when they deem it an appropriate and convenient tool to achieve their ends; b) Standardized technology does not necessarily lead to standardized uses or planning; c) Observable high and even skillful use of technology does not necessarily indicate strong planning; and d) Teachers are not motivated to change the way they plan when their students consistently excel at high stakes tests. The study findings have implications for teacher educators, teachers, and school and district leaders. Understanding how one&rsquo;s own level of TPACK and beliefs affect the choices teachers make during planning for technology integration can guide teachers and districts to identify teachers&rsquo; specific needs in order to make a 1:1 initiative successful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Montgomery, M.C.

The integration of technology in teaching and learning can significantly influence the outcome of education in the classroom. However, there are a myriad of factors that influence technology integration in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variation of teacher integration of technology into classroom instruction. Factors that teachers perceive as being the most influential will be analyzed. The investigation also serves to inform school leaders about specific ways to ensure maximum use of instructional technology by all staff members.</p>\n<p>The study involved a comprehensive high school centrally located in a suburban county in Maryland with an on-time graduation of above 95%.

The case that was investigated in this study is the teacher preparation program at a small comprehensive college located in the upper Great Plains region of the United States. Utilizing a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, both a survey as well as semi-structured interviews provided data to understand pre-service teachers&rsquo; perceptions of their preparation for technology integration. The TPACK framework for technology integration (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006) and self- efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986, 1997) were used as a theoretical framework for understanding pre-service teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy for technology integration. The results of this study indicate that pre-service teachers generally feel confidence with regard to their abilities to integrate technology, but also feel a sense of pressure to be able to teach with technology. The results further suggest that there are a variety of things teacher educators can do to support pre-service teachers in their learning to integrate technology, including modeling technology integration, providing both formal and informal learning opportunities to develop technological knowledge and skills, and helping pre-service teachers understand the link between technological knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and content knowledge. Additionally, the pre- service teachers participating in this study indicated that they believe a practical course in technology integration would help to prepare them for teaching in contemporary classrooms. Based on the findings of this research, a plan of action is suggested for teacher educators interested in fostering pre-service teachers&rsquo; abilities to integrate technology in the classroom.&rdquo;<br />Rios-Parnell, A.

However, a concern exists regarding training that is offered to online higher education instructors based on the professional and technological skills they should master as online instructors. Based on an increased and continue reliance on online remote adjunct faculty members, it is imperative for leaders at higher education institutions to assess not only how the instructors feel about their jobs, duties, and responsibilities and what aspects contribute most to their level of satisfaction with professional and technological development (PTechD) received, but to have a PTechD with an effective evaluation process in place to ensure the online remote adjunct instructors receive the necessary professional and technological skills to be successful online remote adjunct instructors. The main goal of the current study was to formulate some characteristics for a professional and technological development (PTechD) program for online remote adjunct instructors and for the instructors&rsquo; evaluation processes after a PTechD is received. The study was used to examine how instructors perceived their level of preparedness with received PTechD. The qualitative descriptive case study involved the topic of a PTechD program for online remote adjunct instructors in a higher education institution.

Teachers with non-science background and lack of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) may have low self-efficacy toward teaching with technology. Therefore, developing an appropriate instrument is needed for assessing and measuring self-efficacy of elementary in-service teachers in teaching mathematics with information and communications technology (ICT). This instrument can serve as foundation in teachers training and teacher professional development for improvement of teacher education and the future of mathematics education. This study aims to develop a new self-efficacy scale, namely Self-efficacy in Teaching Mathematics with ICT for in-service mathematics teacher.

Prior research suggests that teachers may not be prepared to integrate technologies and other scaffolds that are crucial for students&rsquo; productive engagement with engineering design. Teaching technology skills isolated from the classroom context in which they need to be implemented does not help. Thus, the need of the hour is classroom environments that provide teachers opportunities for engaging deeply and meaningfully with the technology and scaffolding the implementation of technology to support science and engineering learning.

Paper presented at the Global Engineering Education Conference, Athens, Greece.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;A main issue in educating engineer educators on how to integrate technology in teaching is to make them (a) appreciate pedagogical theories as a guide for designing effective learning contexts, as well as (b) approach technology as a cognitive tool instead of a learning outcome &ndash; as they usually do due to the close connection of their discipline with technological advances. It is especially challenging but necessary for integrating technology in a constructivist context, to stimulate conceptual and instructional changes, preparing teachers to focus on pedagogy, content, and technology as well as on the way they need to appropriately combine them in order to design learner-centered, technology enhanced contexts. In this paper, we propose an approach for educating engineer educators on TEL that uses WebQuests as the main methodological tool for cultivating technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). Through WebQuests we aim to cultivate pedagogical and technological skills to student engineers. At the same time, we aim at stimulating them to reflect and elaborate on their subject matter and on how to design learning in an authentic context.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from<br />http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7943007/)</p>\n<p>Rahman, S.

Paper presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition, Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Nonetheless, based on our experience, we believe that despite its tremendous potential robotics cannot be widely incorporated into STEM education curricula until teachers and students develop trust in the robotics. Here, trust of teachers and students in robotics indicates their willingness to believe in the solutions provided by robots and to rely on the contributions of robots in STEM teaching and learning. Human trust in robots is extensively explored in fields such as service, manufacturing, etc. However, trust of teachers and students in robots in robotics-focused STEM education has not been studied yet. This paper is based on our collaboration with 20 teachers of 8 urban, inner-city schools and observations of over 200 students in their robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK framework. Using appropriate questionnaire techniques, we develop a &lsquo;trust vocabulary&rsquo; that contains what the teachers and the students mean by trust in the robots for their lessons, and what factors and features of the robotics may affect their trust. Next, we develop a qualitative trust assessment method using a Likert scale and derive a quantitative trust computational model. We compare the qualitative and quantitative trust measurements and validate the quantitative trust model. We propose several hypotheses and investigate whether there are statistically significant differences in trust in robots between teachers and students, teaching subjects such as science and math, and participants&rsquo; genders. We analyze whether the level of trust of the teachers in robotics effects their pedagogy and the level of trust of the students effects their learning methods. Based on the trust assessment results, we conduct a survey with the teachers and students and offer recommendations that may help enhance the trust levels of the teachers and students in the robotics for STEM education.<br />The results are novel that may advocate using robotics as a trust-worthy pedagogical tool under the TPACK framework, argue incorporating robotics into STEM education curricula in middle schools, and help maintain appropriate levels of trust of teachers and students in robots, which may increase the overall learning outcomes.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from https://peer.asee.org/27990)</p>\n<p>Rahman, S.

Paper presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition, Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;TPACK (technological-pedagogical-content knowledge) is a conceptual framework that reflects the status of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge of educators. The TPACK framework allows teachers to use technology as an effective pedagogical tool to present disciplinary knowledge in readily accessible ways to students, promote active learning, and assist students in comprehending content that is pedagogically challenging. Recent proliferation of robotics as a technology component to facilitate effective pedagogy requires further investigation into TPACK because the teachers not only need to know how to operate robotics under TPACK, but also to incorporate it into teaching their assigned curriculum. Furthermore, situated cognition theory can help guide the development of robotics-focused TPACK, which is dynamic in nature and various factors and contexts may affect its efficacy. However, prior research has not devoted significant effort to explore the dynamic nature of TPACK for teaching STEM in robotics-focused classrooms. In this paper, we explore the dynamic nature of TPACK for teaching STEM with robotics in middle school classrooms. We collaborate with 20 teachers in eight urban, inner-city schools and observe their teaching of robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK. Using questionnaires, we identify the ideal requirements of teachers&rsquo; TPACK to effectively teach STEM lessons using robotics. We also determine the relative importance of the various domains of TPACK. Next, using questionnaires and brainstorming, we identify the factors that may affect the requirements of the technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge and their relative importance. We investigate different strategies and awareness levels of TPACK in different schools. We develop an assessment method to assess the self-efficacy of the teachers to teach robotics-focused STEM lessons under TPACK. We analyze the reasons behind the deficits in the self-efficacy scores and provide recommendations to improve TPACK self-efficacy of the teachers. The results are novel and fundamental that may contribute to expand the conceptual horizon of TPACK, develop and maintain a balanced TPACK for teaching STEM with robotics in middle schools, and also maintain appropriate self-efficacy levels of the teachers, which may enhance the overall learning outcomes of the students.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from https://peer.asee.org/28336)<br />Setiyanti, A.A., &amp; Hunt, J.

Paper presented at the International Conference on Information, Communication Technologies in Education, Rhodes, Greece.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Technological and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) has, in recent years, been the focus of considerable research, particularly in subject specific domains. This paper explores the ideas of TPACK and its relationship to Indonesian elementary pre-service teachers. Links are drawn between Hunt&rsquo;s (2015) use of graphic organisers to explore teaching practices, curriculum connectedness, attributes of the teacher and use of ICT artifacts and a theoretical planning tool, TRIM, the Technological Reflective Integration Matrix (Setiyanti &amp; Hunt, 2016). The outcomes outlined here are preliminary, but encourage the researchers to improve the TRIM model as a way to capture a broader picture of TPACK in a domain not well researched &mdash; elementary pre-service teachers.&rdquo; (Abstract retrieved from<br />http://www.icicte.org/ICICTE_2017_Proceedings/2.3_Setiyanti__Hunt_.pdf)</p>\n<h5>5.

Virtual paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52016/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Computer science (CS) is one of the school subjects that gained a great attention recently, yet it faces challenges such as teacher shortages and huge variability in teachers&rsquo; professional preparation. These challenges make PD efforts even more critical to develop in-service teachers to effectively teach CS topics. This paper presents results from Rice University School Mathematics Project&rsquo;s We Teach CS program, a CS teaching collaborative that provided 20 CS teachers with an innovative professional development. The innovation comes from the four different pathways to serve diverse needs of the teachers in the best way possible and each pathway having several components spread out to several months rather than being one-time, one-shot. The paper will describe each pathway in detail to set an example for other professional development programs. The overarching goal of the program was to develop the self-efficacy and pedagogical content knowledge, which as research shows are integral to successful CS teaching. This study focused on teachers&rsquo; self-efficacy for CS, CS teaching, and computational thinking, and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK). Data collection means include pre- and post-surveys, teacher reflections, and teach interviews. The results are promising in that the collaborative improved teachers in all these areas. The paper also describes the different pathways in detail to provide an example of a successful CS teaching collaborative.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: All conference days (online)</p>\n<p>Ervin-Kassab, L.

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52026/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In 2016 and 2017, California revised both its Teacher Performance Expectations (TPEs) and the teacher performance assessment. In 2017, the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) revised its educator standards. This created a need for a TK-12 teacher preparation program to address preparing pre-service teachers to use educational technology. Institutional post-program survey responses indicate graduates feel unprepared to use educational technology. Initially, the researcher was to revise a technology exam to align with the new standards. The test was found to be an untenable solution. Instead, the program decided to use an online certification option to develop pre-service teacher technology knowledge (TK) of the standards at an introductory level. The program is developing a plan for integrating technology throughout its scope and sequence using a TPACK (Koehler &amp; Mishra, 2009) approach for depth.

This poster presentation shares the findings from a pilot study that explored what knowledge participants perceived they gained from participating in a makerspace experience. Preliminary findings suggest that participants perceived that they had 1) gained knowledge about how to facilitate maker experiences for their students, 2) gained the technical expertise and confidence to use the technologies explored during the makerspace in their own teaching, 3) were able to make curriculum connections with the activities explored in the makerspace, and 4) were able to identify the types of thinking skills being used in different centers.

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from http://new.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/51537/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The notion of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) was modified by multiple authors to become technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK or TPACK), spawning much active and dynamic scholarship since 2001. Currently, many researchers see TPCK/TPACK as the knowledge that teachers need to integrate technologies effectively into learning and teaching. Shulman&rsquo;s PCK, however, was just one element in a much larger conceptualization of a knowledge base for educators, and that full range of knowledge was posited as being used by teachers in recursive processes of pedagogical reasoning and action. This begs the question: if there is TPCK/TPACK, which is rooted in PCK, as many studies have suggested, is there also technological pedagogical reasoning and action (TPR&amp;A)? If so, what are its distinguishing characteristics? If not, why would TPCK not be mirrored in TPR&amp;A? These questions are addressed in the following multivocal literature review.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29th 1:45 PM-2:15 PM, Bell</p>\n<p>Harris, L., Yearta, L., &amp; Chapman, H.

In working with a secondary English teacher, Mary, who was working on her master&rsquo;s degree action research capstone project, I witnessed professional expertise change. Mary brainstormed and tried out a couple of new instructional strategies that included the use of cell phones and laptops in new ways. Mary constructed knowledge of instructional strategies and assessment with technology that supports student achievement in her English classroom and engages her students more meaningful in the learning process.

Pearson correlation was conducted to analyze the relationship between students&rsquo; TPACK and their demonstrations of TPACK via lesson plans while descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyze to what extent preservice teachers incorporated TPACK into their lesson plans. The results indicate that there appears to be a mismatch between knowledge (theory) and practice of preservice teachers with respect their TPACK. That is, self-assessment of preservice teachers&rsquo; technology knowledge was found higher than their actual technology integration into lesson plans.

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52513/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The present study addresses the lack of a theoretical framework for the integration of technology in music teaching and learning, and explores, within the framework of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge the importance of affect in instructional design. The authors propose a set of music-specific design principles based on the TPCK framework while identifying the interrelations among musical content, emotions, and technology. The design guidelines were tested in an empirical investigation and statistically significant differences were found between the control and the experimental groups in favor of the experimental group. Further investigation is necessary to test the effectiveness of the proposed design principles. Including affect in the design process is a complicated and mostly unchartered area, and, thus, further research toward this direction is fully justified. Through the inclusion of affect in the learning design, the research has practical and theoretical significance as it addresses a gap in both the TPCK/ TPACK and music education literature.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Tuesday, March 27 10:45 AM-11:15 AM, Edison A</p>\n<p>Musgrove, A., Powers, J., Gonzalez-DeHass, A., &amp; Willems, P.

Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52638/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this review of multiple reinterpretations of TPCK/TPACK that have emerged over time, we trace the construct&rsquo;s roots not only to PCK, but more importantly to Shulman&rsquo;s (1987) knowledge base for teaching, within which PCK was originally situated. We suggest that TPACK is a special case of PCK which sits within the considerably broader knowledge base for teaching, basing this assertion upon Cox&rsquo;s (2008) explanation of the differences between teachers&rsquo; PCK and TPACK. Following Cox, we argue that TPACK references only the specific nature of a teacher&rsquo;s PCK when unfamiliar digital tools are considered and implemented for educational purposes. We recommend that TPACK researchers distinguish among the different categories of teachers&rsquo; knowledge, reasoning, and action more clearly, bounding TPACK more narrowly in ways that mirror how Shulman delineated PCK with reference to the six other components comprising his knowledge base for teaching.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29th 2:15 PM-2:45 PM, Bell</p>\n<p>Poyo, S.

Roundtable presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52029/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Recently, a boom in tech industries locating within a western state have led to the laying of hundreds of miles of fiber optic cable from north to south within the state&rsquo;s borders. The potential impact this will have on education for the more than 50,000 K-12 students living in rural and frontier communities along that route could be tremendous. A question raised is: are the districts administrators and instructional staff prepared to integrate technology into their curriculum? To facility a greater understanding of this preparedness, a technological, pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) survey of the administrative and instructional staff will be completed. Analysis of the results will provide the base data to create a site-specific, individualized professional development program that will focus on use of technology and active integration in both core and elective courses to enhance student engagement, retention, and academic success.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 1:45 PM-2:45 PM, Edison Ballroom D</p>\n<p>Smits, A., &amp; van Velze, L.

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52510/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Our graduate course &lsquo;learning with ICT&rsquo; targets the development of TPACK through conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and educational design. In this study we qualitatively analyzed the outcomes of the course. The main research questions are: What conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and TPACK enactment are visible in students&rsquo; written and video assignments after the course? And how are these related? Qualitative analyses of conceptual understanding, pedagogical reasoning and TPACK enactment was performed in the software package QDA miner with the help of a categorical dictionary and codebooks derived from the content of the course. The results showed that students differed greatly in their conceptual understanding and in their pedagogical reasoning. However, most students designed and enacted a lesson that showed TPACK enactment. This may mean that in some students TPACK enactment may merely be performance driven. Students with a strong conceptual understanding and pedagogical reasoning, may be more likely to show transfer of TPACK enactment to future teaching situations.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 3:40 &ndash; 4:00 PM, Wright</p>\n<p>Tomayko, M.

Paper presented at the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education 29th International Conference, Washington, D.C. Abstract retrieved from https://www.academicexperts.org/conf/site/2018/papers/52544/</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In this study, pre-service teachers (PSTs) in an instructional technology course used a visual quantitative model to track their growth in the seven knowledge domains associated with Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Written reflections by the PSTs provided insights into self-reported ratings that improved, stayed constant, or declined. Preliminary findings indicate that PSTs&rsquo; growth in TPACK was often attributed to the applied and practical nature of course activities as well as the PSTs&rsquo; increased confidence with using technology. PSTs were also able to describe actionable next steps to further grow their TPACK in areas that were stagnant. While few PSTs reported areas where knowledge declined, it is speculated that this was a result of PSTs initial overestimate of their knowledge.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Thursday, March 29 11:30-11:50 AM, Whitney</p>\n<p>Valtonen, T., Kukkonen, J., Sointu, E., Pontinen, S., Stehlik, T., Naykki, P., &hellip; Makitalo-Siegl, K.

Characterizing prospective secondary mathematics teachers&rsquo; experience of creating video lessons using iPad. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New York, NY.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;Teacher educators are often pressed to create experiences for future teachers to engage in the practice of teaching mathematics with technology. In this paper, we describe how preservice teachers in a methods class incorporated their knowledge of technology, mathematics, and pedagogy in a project of creating video lessons using an app called ExplainEverything on iPad. We characterize their experiences using the TPACK framework (Mishra &amp; Koehler, 2006). Results from qualitative analysis suggest participants demonstrated effective use of technology, pedagogical techniques, and mathematical representations using technology. Implications for practice include a recommendation to implement a cycle of learning in which preservice teachers can refine their pedagogical strategies, the rigor in their mathematics, and their use of mathematical action technology.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Tue, April 17, 8:15 to 9:45 AM, Sheraton New York Times Square, Second Floor, Empire Ballroom East</p>\n<p>Cheng, S.-L., &amp; Xie, K.

Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New York, NY.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;The purpose of this study is to examine the relations among teacher demographic characteristics, value beliefs, and TPACK perceptions. 109 in-service teachers from the state of Ohio participated in this study. Our findings reveal that the relations of TPACK perceptions with demographic characteristics and value beliefs replicate those found in other research studies. Value beliefs, technology use, gender, and years of teaching significantly predict TPACK perceptions outside the context of intervention. In addition, value beliefs moderate the relations of TPACK perceptions with gender, age, and technology use. When the effects of demographic characteristics and value beliefs on TPACK perceptions are investigated in the context of intervention, teaching level and value beliefs are the only significant predictors of end-of-the-program TPACK perceptions.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Sat, April 14, 4:05 to 5:35 PM, New York Marriott Marquis, Seventh Floor, Chelsea/Gotham Room</p>\n<p>Dickenson, P.

Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, New York, NY.</p>\n<p>Abstract: &ldquo;In 2016, a state credentialing agency adopted a new set of Teacher Performance Expectations (TPEs) that highlights: A) an in-depth usage of technology to enhance instruction; B) the impact of K-12 students&rsquo; assets as &ldquo;funds of knowledge&rdquo; that can be used as a resource for instruction. In order to address the new TPEs the state agency was tasked with redeveloping their Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) with a goal that the new assessment drive teacher preparation programs to refocus their curriculum in areas relating to equity, inclusion, and educational technology.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the ways in which the redesigned state sponsored Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) is designed to disrupt traditional frameworks in teacher preparation that are anchored in deficit ideology and the superficial treatments of educational technology. Most teacher preparation programs address &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; through a multicultural approach that includes a single course about diversity that is embedded in curriculum, or through learning activities, integrated throughout the program, that requires candidates to plan for culturally driven learning activities that are often simplified to diverse celebrations and songs (Nieto, 2000). In both of these instances, the focus is on culture, which tends to essentialize students who come from marginalized groups instead of addressing the inequities that these students face in the classroom as it pertains to access and inclusion (Tyler, 2016; Gorski, 2016). With that, more recent research relating to &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; has called for a shift in teacher preparation that extends beyond multicultural approaches to more equity-driven instruction (Darling-Hammond, 2015; Gorski, 2016).</p>\n<p>In alignment with these trends, this paper reviews how the redesigned TPA has included a number of elements that require candidates to gather data about their students that allows them to be more inclusive and equity-driven in their practices, so that student differences are viewed as resources and assets, instead of as deficits which continues to be present in the thinking among many teachers today (Lambeth &amp; Smith, 2016; Valencia, 2010). The inclusion of these elements emerged from the outcomes of design team perspectives, focus group data, and survey data that originated from pilot testing and an external bias review panel.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this paper will also highlight how educational technology will be addressed in the redesigned TPA by asking candidates to enhance student learning experiences through technology. Currently, there is a disconnect between the technology related expectations that new teachers have in the classroom, and the type of training that is received in credential programs. For example, in many classrooms, there is currently a push for teachers to advance a model of teaching where technology, pedagogy and content knowledge intersect (TPACK). However, in many credential programs, TPACK is rarely discussed in content knowledge and pedagogical methods related courses. With the goal of utilizing technology in such a way that enhances learning, the redesigned TPA requires candidates to integrate technology into a lesson, provide a rationale for the technological interventions chosen, and to document their lesson via video.&rdquo;<br />Date/Time: Mon, April 16, 4:05 to 6:05 PM, New York Hilton Midtown, Concourse Level, Concourse B Room</p>\n<p>Thomas, A., Edson, A.
